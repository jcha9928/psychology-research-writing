### Title

**"Mindfulness Training Reduces Anxiety in College Students"**

---

### Abstract (250 words)

**Background**: Anxiety is a major public health problem among college students, with prevalence rates increasing over the past decade. Some research has suggested that mindfulness-based interventions may be beneficial for reducing anxiety symptoms in various populations. However, the effectiveness of mindfulness training specifically for college students remains unclear.

**Methods**: Eighty undergraduate students with elevated anxiety were randomly assigned to either an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program or a waitlist control condition. Participants completed self-report measures of anxiety and perceived stress at pre-test and post-test.

**Results**: Results showed that participants in the MBSR group reported significantly lower anxiety scores at post-test compared to the control group. The effect size was moderate to large. There was also a significant reduction in perceived stress.

**Conclusions**: These findings suggest that mindfulness training can be effective for reducing anxiety in college students. This has important implications for mental health interventions on college campuses.

### Introduction (8 paragraphs, ~2,500 words)

#### Paragraph 1: General Background on Anxiety

Anxiety disorders represent one of the most common mental health problems worldwide, affecting millions of people each year. The prevalence of anxiety has been increasing over the past several decades, particularly among young adults. College students face unique stressors related to academic demands, social transitions, and financial pressures, which can contribute to elevated anxiety levels. Recent surveys have found that approximately 41.6% of college students report experiencing anxiety symptoms. This is concerning because anxiety can have negative impacts on academic performance, social relationships, and overall well-being. Traditional treatments for anxiety include cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacological interventions, but these approaches may not be accessible or acceptable to all students. Therefore, there is a need for alternative interventions that can be easily implemented in college settings.

#### Paragraph 2: What is Mindfulness?

Mindfulness has been defined as the practice of paying attention to the present moment in a non-judgmental way. It involves cultivating awareness of one's thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations without trying to change or avoid them. The concept of mindfulness has its roots in Buddhist meditation practices, but has been adapted for use in Western clinical and educational settings. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a structured 8-week program developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn in the 1970s. The program includes guided meditation, body scan exercises, and gentle yoga. Participants typically meet for 2-2.5 hours per week and are encouraged to practice mindfulness at home for 45 minutes daily. MBSR has been widely implemented in hospitals, clinics, and community centers around the world.

#### Paragraph 3: Evidence for Mindfulness and Anxiety

There has been some research on the effects of mindfulness-based interventions for anxiety. A meta-analysis by Hofmann et al. (2010) found that mindfulness-based therapy showed moderate effects for reducing anxiety symptoms compared to control conditions. Another study by Khoury et al. (2013) reported similar findings, with effect sizes in the moderate range. However, these meta-analyses included diverse populations including clinical patients, community samples, and some student samples. The results suggest that mindfulness may be beneficial, but it is unclear whether the effects generalize to specific populations like college students. Some studies have examined mindfulness in college students specifically. For example, Regehr, Glancy, and Pitts (2013) found that a mindfulness intervention reduced stress in law students. Similarly, Shapiro, Brown, and Biegel (2007) reported that MBSR decreased anxiety and increased positive affect in medical students. These findings are promising, but more research is needed.

#### Paragraph 4: Limitations of Prior Research

Despite the growing body of research on mindfulness and anxiety, several limitations exist. First, many studies have used relatively small sample sizes, which may limit statistical power and generalizability of findings. Second, some studies have lacked adequate control conditions, making it difficult to rule out alternative explanations such as placebo effects or the passage of time. Third, the mechanisms underlying the effects of mindfulness on anxiety are not well understood. While some theories suggest that mindfulness works through improved emotion regulation or reduced rumination, these mechanisms have not been thoroughly tested. Fourth, most studies have focused on clinical populations or high-risk groups, and fewer studies have examined mindfulness in general college student populations who may have subclinical levels of anxiety.

#### Paragraph 5: Importance of Studying College Students

College students represent an important population for several reasons. First, late adolescence and early adulthood are critical periods for the development and onset of anxiety disorders. Second, college students often face unique stressors that differ from those experienced by other populations. These stressors include academic pressure, social challenges, identity development, and transition to independence. Third, anxiety in college students can have long-lasting consequences, including academic underachievement, attrition, and reduced career prospects. Fourth, college campuses provide an ideal setting for implementing preventive interventions that can reach large numbers of students. However, despite these factors, research on mindfulness interventions specifically for college student anxiety is limited.

#### Paragraph 6: Theoretical Background

Several theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain how mindfulness might reduce anxiety. One prominent theory is the emotional regulation model, which suggests that mindfulness enhances the ability to observe and accept emotions without becoming overwhelmed by them. According to this model, individuals with anxiety tend to engage in avoidance or suppression of negative emotions, which paradoxically increases anxiety symptoms. Mindfulness training may help break this cycle by teaching individuals to approach emotions with curiosity and acceptance rather than avoidance. Another theory is the decentering model, which proposes that mindfulness helps individuals adopt a metacognitive perspective on their thoughts and feelings, recognizing them as temporary mental events rather than facts about reality. This shift in perspective may reduce the impact of anxious thoughts.

#### Paragraph 7: Current Study Overview

The current study was designed to address some of the gaps in the existing literature. Specifically, we examined the effectiveness of an 8-week MBSR program for reducing anxiety in college students with elevated anxiety symptoms. We hypothesized that participants who received MBSR training would show greater reductions in anxiety compared to a waitlist control group. We also explored whether changes in perceived stress would mediate the relationship between mindfulness training and anxiety reduction. This study contributes to the literature by using a randomized controlled design, adequate sample size, and validated self-report measures.

#### Paragraph 8: Research Questions and Hypotheses

The primary research question was: Does MBSR training reduce anxiety symptoms in college students? We predicted that:
1. Participants in the MBSR group would show significantly lower anxiety scores at post-test compared to the control group.
2. The effect would be maintained when controlling for baseline anxiety levels.
3. Perceived stress would mediate the relationship between MBSR and anxiety reduction.

### Methods (3 subsections, ~1,800 words)

#### Participants

Eighty undergraduate students were recruited from introductory psychology courses at a large Midwestern university. Participants were eligible if they scored above the clinical cutoff on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Exclusion criteria included current participation in psychotherapy or regular meditation practice. The sample consisted of 62 females and 18 males, with a mean age of 19.4 years (SD = 1.2). Most participants were freshman (45%) or sophomores (35%), with smaller proportions of juniors (15%) and seniors (5%). Participants received course credit for their involvement in the study. All participants provided informed consent before enrollment.

#### Measures

**State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)**: The STAI is a widely used self-report measure of anxiety consisting of 40 items. The state anxiety subscale measures current feelings of anxiety, while the trait anxiety subscale measures general anxiety proneness. Items are rated on a 4-point scale. The STAI has good reliability and validity. In the current study, we used the trait anxiety subscale as our primary outcome measure.

**Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)**: The PSS is a 10-item measure of perceived stress over the past month. Items assess the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. The PSS has been shown to be reliable and valid in college student populations.

#### Procedure

Participants who met eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to either the MBSR intervention (n=40) or waitlist control (n=40) condition. Randomization was conducted using a computer-generated random number sequence. Participants in both conditions completed self-report measures at baseline (pre-test) and after the 8-week intervention period (post-test).

**MBSR Intervention**: The intervention consisted of an 8-week MBSR program following the protocol developed by Kabat-Zinn. Sessions were held once per week for 2.5 hours each. The program included guided meditation, body scan exercises, and gentle yoga. Participants were instructed to practice mindfulness exercises at home for 45 minutes daily. Sessions were led by a certified MBSR instructor with over 10 years of experience. Attendance was monitored, and participants who attended fewer than 6 of 8 sessions were excluded from analyses.

**Control Condition**: Participants in the waitlist control condition did not receive any intervention during the 8-week period. They were told they would have the opportunity to participate in the MBSR program after completing the post-test assessment.

### Results (~1,200 words)

#### Preliminary Analyses

Preliminary analyses examined whether the randomization procedure resulted in equivalent groups at baseline. There were no significant differences between the MBSR and control groups on age, gender, or baseline anxiety levels (all ps > .05). This suggests that randomization was successful.

#### Primary Analyses

The primary analyses examined whether MBSR reduced anxiety compared to the control condition. We conducted a 2 (Group: MBSR vs. Control) × 2 (Time: Pre-test vs. Post-test) mixed ANOVA with anxiety scores as the dependent variable.

The analysis revealed a significant main effect of Time, F(1,78) = 15.32, p < .001, indicating that anxiety decreased from pre-test to post-test across both groups. There was also a significant main effect of Group, F(1,78) = 8.45, p < .01, indicating that the MBSR group had lower overall anxiety than the control group. Most importantly, there was a significant Group × Time interaction, F(1,78) = 12.67, p < .001, indicating that the MBSR group showed a greater reduction in anxiety from pre-test to post-test compared to the control group.

Post-hoc analyses examined the simple effects of Time within each group. For the MBSR group, anxiety scores decreased significantly from pre-test (M = 52.3, SD = 8.1) to post-test (M = 43.8, SD = 7.9), t(39) = 6.23, p < .001. For the control group, there was a smaller, non-significant decrease from pre-test (M = 51.7, SD = 8.3) to post-test (M = 49.5, SD = 8.6), t(39) = 1.78, p = .08.

The effect size for the Group × Time interaction was partial eta-squared = .14, which is considered a medium to large effect according to Cohen's (1988) guidelines. Cohen's d for the between-group difference at post-test (controlling for pre-test scores) was 0.72, indicating a large effect.

#### Perceived Stress as a Mediator

We examined whether perceived stress mediated the relationship between MBSR and anxiety reduction using the PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2013). The mediation model tested whether MBSR → reduced stress → reduced anxiety.

Results showed that MBSR significantly predicted reduced perceived stress at post-test (controlling for baseline stress), b = -3.45, SE = 1.12, p < .01. Perceived stress at post-test significantly predicted anxiety at post-test (controlling for baseline anxiety), b = 0.65, SE = 0.18, p < .001. The indirect effect of MBSR on anxiety through perceived stress was significant, b = -2.24, 95% CI [-4.12, -0.67], indicating that stress reduction mediated the effect of MBSR on anxiety. However, there was also a direct effect of MBSR on anxiety that remained significant after controlling for stress, b = -3.21, SE = 1.45, p < .05, suggesting partial mediation.

#### Additional Analyses

We also examined whether baseline anxiety moderated the effectiveness of MBSR. The Group × Baseline Anxiety interaction was not significant, F(1,76) = 1.23, p = .27, suggesting that MBSR was equally effective for participants with varying levels of baseline anxiety. Additionally, we found no significant effects of gender, F(1,76) = 0.45, p = .51, or class year, F(3,74) = 1.67, p = .18, on treatment outcomes.

### Discussion (~2,300 words)

#### Summary of Findings

The current study examined the effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for reducing anxiety in college students. Our findings showed that participants who received 8 weeks of MBSR training experienced significantly greater reductions in anxiety compared to waitlist control participants. The effect size was large (d = 0.72), suggesting that MBSR has meaningful clinical benefits for this population. Additionally, we found that perceived stress partially mediated the relationship between MBSR and anxiety reduction, suggesting that one mechanism through which mindfulness reduces anxiety is by decreasing stress appraisals.

#### Interpretation and Implications

These results are consistent with previous research showing that mindfulness-based interventions can reduce anxiety symptoms. However, our study extends this work by demonstrating the effectiveness of MBSR specifically for college students with elevated anxiety. This is important because college students face unique stressors and may respond differently to interventions compared to clinical populations. The large effect size observed in our study suggests that MBSR could be a valuable addition to college mental health services.

The mediation analysis provides preliminary evidence that stress reduction is one pathway through which mindfulness training decreases anxiety. This is consistent with theoretical models suggesting that mindfulness enhances emotion regulation and reduces maladaptive stress responses. However, the finding of partial (rather than full) mediation suggests that other mechanisms may also be involved. Future research should examine additional potential mediators, such as emotion regulation, rumination, or self-compassion.

From a practical standpoint, our findings have several implications. First, college counseling centers and health promotion programs may consider offering MBSR as a preventive intervention for students with elevated anxiety. MBSR has the advantage of being a group-based intervention, which makes it cost-effective and scalable. Second, the results suggest that even a relatively brief (8-week) intervention can produce meaningful improvements in anxiety symptoms. This is important given the time constraints and resource limitations that often exist in college settings.

#### Comparison with Previous Studies

Our findings are generally consistent with previous meta-analyses showing moderate to large effects of mindfulness interventions on anxiety (Hofmann et al., 2010; Khoury et al., 2013). However, our effect size (d = 0.72) was somewhat larger than the average effect sizes reported in these meta-analyses (typically d = 0.50-0.60). This could be due to several factors, including our focus on college students specifically, our use of a standardized MBSR protocol, and the relatively high adherence rates in our sample.

Compared to previous studies with college students, our results are similar to those reported by Shapiro et al. (2007) who found that MBSR reduced anxiety in medical students. However, our study improves upon this work by using a larger sample size and a more rigorous control condition. Our findings are also consistent with studies showing that mindfulness reduces stress in college populations (Regehr et al., 2013).

#### Strengths and Limitations

This study has several strengths. First, we used a randomized controlled design, which allows for stronger causal inferences about the effects of MBSR. Second, our sample size was adequate to detect medium to large effects with good statistical power. Third, we used validated self-report measures with good psychometric properties. Fourth, we had high retention rates, with only 3 participants dropping out of the study.

However, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, we relied exclusively on self-report measures, which are subject to response biases and may not capture all aspects of anxiety. Future studies should include behavioral or physiological measures of anxiety. Second, our control condition was a waitlist control, which does not control for non-specific factors such as social interaction and expectancy effects. Future studies should include an active control condition to better isolate the specific effects of mindfulness training. Third, we only assessed outcomes immediately post-intervention. It remains unclear whether the benefits of MBSR are maintained over time. Longitudinal follow-up studies are needed to examine the durability of treatment effects.

Fourth, our sample consisted primarily of female students from a single university, which may limit generalizability to other populations. Fifth, we did not assess treatment adherence beyond session attendance. Participants' engagement in home practice may have varied considerably, and this could have influenced outcomes. Sixth, the mechanisms underlying the effects of MBSR remain only partially understood. While we found evidence for stress reduction as a mediator, other mechanisms such as emotion regulation or cognitive changes were not examined. Seventh, individual differences in response to MBSR were not thoroughly investigated. Some participants may benefit more than others, and identifying moderators of treatment response would be valuable for personalizing interventions.

#### Future Directions

Future research should address these limitations and extend our findings in several ways. First, studies should include longer follow-up periods to assess the maintenance of treatment effects. Second, active control conditions should be used to better isolate the specific effects of mindfulness training. Third, research should examine additional mechanisms through which mindfulness reduces anxiety, including emotion regulation, rumination, and self-compassion. Fourth, studies should investigate potential moderators of treatment response to identify who benefits most from MBSR. Fifth, research should examine the effectiveness of MBSR for specific anxiety disorders (e.g., social anxiety, generalized anxiety) rather than just elevated anxiety symptoms.

Sixth, future studies could examine the optimal "dose" of mindfulness training. While we used the standard 8-week MBSR protocol, it is possible that shorter or longer interventions might be more effective for certain individuals or outcomes. Seventh, research should explore the integration of MBSR with other evidence-based treatments for anxiety. For example, combining mindfulness training with cognitive-behavioral therapy might produce synergistic effects. Eighth, more research is needed on the implementation of MBSR in real-world college settings, including factors that influence uptake, adherence, and dissemination.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, the current study provides evidence that Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction is an effective intervention for reducing anxiety in college students. The large effect size and evidence for stress reduction as a mediating mechanism suggest that MBSR could be a valuable addition to college mental health services. While several limitations should be addressed in future research, our findings contribute to the growing body of literature supporting the use of mindfulness-based interventions for anxiety. As rates of anxiety continue to rise among college students, evidence-based preventive interventions like MBSR will become increasingly important for promoting student mental health and well-being.

## Diagnostic Summary: What's Wrong with This Paper?

### 🔭 MACRO-LEVEL PROBLEMS (Structure & Logic)

#### Problem 1: Message Drift
- **Title**: "Mindfulness Training **Reduces** Anxiety" (causal claim)
- **Abstract conclusion**: "...***can be*** effective" (hedging, weakens claim)
- **Discussion conclusion**: "...***could be*** a valuable addition" (further hedging)
→ **Issue**: Title makes strong claim, but Abstract/Discussion hedge. Inconsistent message.

#### Problem 2: Gap-Method Mismatch
- **Introduction Gap** (implied): "Mechanisms underlying mindfulness effects are not well understood"
- **Methods**: Standard MBSR vs waitlist, no mechanistic tests beyond mediation
→ **Issue**: Introduction suggests mechanistic focus, but Methods only test effectiveness (incremental, not mechanistic)

#### Problem 3: Inverted Pyramid (Section Imbalance)
- Introduction: 2,500 words (43% of paper)
- Methods: 1,800 words (31%)
- Results: 1,200 words (21%)
- Discussion: 2,300 words (39% - overlaps with Intro length)
→ **Issue**: Introduction is bloated (should be ~20-25%, not 43%). Results too short (should be ~25-30%, not 21%).

### 🔬 MESO-LEVEL PROBLEMS (Paragraphs & Sections)

#### Problem 4: Introduction Paragraph 1 Doing 3 Jobs
- Job 1: General anxiety statistics
- Job 2: College student stressors
- Job 3: Need for alternative interventions
→ **Issue**: Should be split into 3 separate paragraphs, each with clear topic sentence

#### Problem 5: Introduction Paragraph 3 - Old→New Flow Violation
- Sentence 1: "There has been some research..." (introduces "some research")
- Sentence 2: "A meta-analysis by Hofmann et al..." (jumps to specific meta-analysis, no connection)
- Sentence 3: "Another study by Khoury et al..." (continues specific studies)
→ **Issue**: Sentence 1 says "some research" (vague), Sentence 2 doesn't build on "some research" - abrupt jump

#### Problem 6: Methods Subsections Lack Topic Sentences
- **Participants subsection**: Starts with "Eighty undergraduate students were recruited..." (detail, not overview)
- **Should start with**: "We recruited eighty undergraduates with elevated anxiety from a Midwestern university."
→ **Issue**: Diving into details without overview makes section hard to scan

### 🔍 MICRO-LEVEL PROBLEMS (Sentences & Words)

#### Problem 7: Excessive Hedging (Abstract)
- "Some research has ***suggested***" (hedge 1)
- "***may be*** beneficial" (hedge 2)
- "remains ***unclear***" (hedge 3)
- "***can be*** effective" (hedge 4)
→ **Issue**: 4 hedges in 250-word abstract weakens claims unnecessarily (meta-analyses show strong effects!)

#### Problem 8: Nominalization (Throughout)
- "the **effectiveness** of mindfulness training" → "how effective mindfulness training is" or "whether mindfulness training works"
- "showed a greater **reduction** in anxiety" → "reduced anxiety more"
- "The **implementation** of MBSR" → "Implementing MBSR"
→ **Issue**: Actions hidden in nouns (-ness, -tion, -ment) instead of verbs

#### Problem 9: Subject-Verb Distance (Results section)
- "The analysis, which examined the Group × Time interaction for anxiety scores using a mixed ANOVA with repeated measures, ***revealed*** a significant main effect..."
→ Subject: "analysis", Verb: "revealed", Distance: 18 words
→ **Issue**: Reader forgets what the subject is by the time they reach the verb

#### Problem 10: APA Citation Errors (References)
- **Hofmann et al. (2010)**: Missing DOI [should add https://doi.org/10.1037/a0018555]
- **Khoury et al. (2013)**: "and Hofmann" should be "& Hofmann" in reference list [APA rule: use "&" in references]
→ **Issue**: Top journals desk-reject for careless formatting errors

### 🔬 RIGOR PROBLEMS (Methods/Results)

#### Problem 11: Reproducibility Gaps (Reproducibility Score: 22/30 = 73%)
- **Participants**: Missing recruitment period, compensation details, IRB approval
- **Measures**: STAI internal consistency (α) not reported for THIS sample
- **Procedure**: Home practice compliance not assessed beyond attendance
- **Analysis**: No mention of assumption checks (normality, homogeneity)
→ **Issue**: Adequate but not excellent - missing details reduce reproducibility

#### Problem 12: Control Condition Weakness
- **Waitlist control**: Does not control for expectancy, social interaction, time/attention
- **Better**: Active control (e.g., stress education, health seminar)
→ **Issue**: Can't rule out placebo effects or non-specific benefits of group participation

#### Problem 13: Missing Effect Size Confidence Intervals
- "Cohen's d for the between-group difference... was 0.72"
- **Missing**: 95% CI for d (e.g., [0.48, 1.14])
→ **Issue**: Point estimate without CI doesn't show precision of effect

### 🎯 NOVELTY PROBLEM (Introduction)

#### Problem 14: Incremental Gap, Not Conceptual
- **Gap stated**: "Research on mindfulness interventions specifically for college student anxiety is limited"
- **Gap type**: Population substitution (mindfulness tested in other pops, now testing in college students)
- **NOT**: Conceptual gap (new theory), Mechanistic gap (new pathway), Translational gap (bench→bedside)
→ **Issue**: For Psychological Science (top-tier), incremental gap is insufficient. Needs theoretical advance.

**Statistical Rigor**: 7/10 (appropriate tests, but missing CIs for effect sizes, no assumption checks reported)
**Transparency**: 8/10 (all results reported)

**Average**: 7.2/10

**Decision**: Minor Revision
- Add reproducibility details (recruitment period, IRB, α for measures in this sample)
- Acknowledge waitlist control limitation
- Add 95% CIs for all effect sizes

---

### Reviewer 2 (Theoretical Contribution): **Major Revision**

**Gap Quality**: 3/10 (Incremental - population substitution, not conceptual)
**Novelty**: 4/10 (Findings are predictable from prior meta-analyses)
**Theory Advancement**: 3/10 (Mediation analysis is standard, not novel mechanism)
**Broader Impact**: 4/10 (Interesting to college mental health, but limited theoretical advance)
**Literature Integration**: 7/10 (Good review, but doesn't identify clear conceptual gap)

**Average**: 4.2/10

**Decision**: Major Revision or Reject for Psychological Science
- **Problem**: This is an incremental contribution (mindfulness works in college students, we already knew it works in general)
- **Solution**: Reframe gap as mechanistic (HOW mindfulness works in high-stress populations) OR compare competing theoretical mechanisms
- **Alternative**: Target mid-tier journal where incremental work is acceptable

---

### Reviewer 3 (Supportive but Critical Friend): **Major Revision**

**Agree with Reviewer 1?** Partially
- Methodological issues are real but fixable

**Agree with Reviewer 2?** Fully
- This is incremental work, insufficient for Psychological Science

**Greatest Strength**: Rigorous RCT with adequate sample size and validated measures

**Greatest Weakness**: Incremental gap - testing mindfulness in new population without theoretical advance

**Decision**: Major Revision
- IF authors can reframe gap as conceptual/mechanistic → Minor Revision → potential Accept
- IF gap remains incremental → Recommend re-targeting to mid-tier journal

**Path Forward**:
1. Reframe Introduction: Focus on mechanistic question (stress-buffering pathway in high-stress context)
2. Strengthen mediation analysis discussion: This tests competing theories (stress vs emotion regulation)
3. Trim Introduction from 8 paragraphs to 5
4. Add reproducibility details to Methods
5. Add 95% CIs to all effect sizes in Results
6. Acknowledge control limitation in Discussion
7. Fix APA errors in References

Use this paper to practice Reviewer 1, 2, 3 simulations (Template 5.1).

**Expected Results**:
- Reviewer 1: Should catch reproducibility gaps, waitlist control issue, missing CIs
- Reviewer 2: Should identify incremental gap as major problem
- Reviewer 3: Should recommend Major Revision with path forward

### Activity 2: 3-Pass Revision Practice
Use this paper to practice Macro → Meso → Micro revision (Template 5.2).

**Macro Pass**: Identify message drift (Title vs Discussion), gap-method mismatch, section imbalance
**Meso Pass**: Fix Introduction paragraph 1 (split into 3), improve Old→New flow in paragraph 3

## Pedagogical Notes for Instructors

### Why This Example?
- **Realistic**: Represents typical student work (competent but needs revision)
- **Multi-level Problems**: Issues at Macro, Meso, Micro levels (demonstrates need for 3-Pass)
- **Fixable**: Nothing fatal - all problems can be addressed with revision
- **Common Patterns**: Incremental gap, hedging, nominalization, waitlist control - students make these mistakes frequently

### Teaching Points:
1. **Not all problems are equal**: Reviewer 2's gap concern (Major) > Reviewer 1's missing CIs (Minor)
2. **Incremental vs Conceptual**: This paper's biggest weakness is insufficient novelty for top-tier journal
3. **3-Pass Prevents Waste**: Don't polish sentences (Micro) in Introduction if you're going to delete paragraphs (Macro)
4. **Hedging Calibration**: Students over-hedge when they have strong evidence (meta-analyses support mindfulness effects)

### Common Student Questions:
**Q**: "Is this paper really that bad? It seems fine to me."
**A**: It's not bad - it's adequate for a mid-tier journal. But Psychological Science expects conceptual contribution, not just population testing. That's why Reviewer 2 gives 4.2/10.

**Q**: "Can't we just fix the small issues and submit?"
**A**: No - the fundamental problem is the incremental gap. Small fixes (APA errors, CIs) won't change Reviewer 2's decision. Need major reframing.

**Q**: "Should we give up and target a lower-tier journal?"
**A**: Not necessarily! If you can reframe the gap as mechanistic (stress-buffering in high-stress contexts) and strengthen theoretical contribution, Psychological Science is still possible. See Example 5.3 for how to do this.
