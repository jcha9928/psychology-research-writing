## Workshop Timeline (25 minutes)

### Phase 1: Individual AI Simulations (15 min)

**Minutes 1-5**: Reviewer 1 (Methodological)
- Copy paper sections (Methods + Results)
- Run AI prompt
- Record scores and critical issues in Zone A

**Minutes 6-10**: Reviewer 2 (Theoretical)
- Copy paper sections (Introduction + Discussion)
- Run AI prompt
- Record novelty assessment and concerns in Zone B

**Minutes 11-15**: Reviewer 3 (Synthesis)
- Copy Reviewer 1 & 2 outputs + full paper
- Run AI prompt
- Record final decision and path forward in Zone C

### Phase 2: Synthesis & Action Planning (10 min)

**Minutes 16-20**: Individual synthesis
- Identify common themes across 3 reviews
- Categorize issues (Critical/Important/Minor)
- Estimate time needed for each fix

**Minutes 21-25**: Peer sharing
- 3-4 students volunteer to share their synthesis
- What were the harshest criticisms?
- What were surprising strengths?
- Class discussion: Are AI reviewers harsher/easier than real reviewers?

---

## Success Criteria

**For Students**:
- ‚úÖ Completed all 3 reviewer simulations
- ‚úÖ Identified at least 3 critical issues
- ‚úÖ Created prioritized action plan
- ‚úÖ Realistic time estimates for fixes
- ‚úÖ Clear next immediate step

**For Instructors** (facilitation checklist):
- ‚úÖ All students connected to Figma and accessing prompts
- ‚úÖ Monitor progress in Zones A/B/C (intervene if stuck)
- ‚úÖ Highlight exemplar syntheses with @mentions
- ‚úÖ Facilitate peer discussion about harsh vs fair feedback
- ‚úÖ Collect common critical issues for class patterns

---

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: AI too harsh or too lenient
**Symptom**: All scores <5 or all scores >8
**Solution**: Revise prompt with comparative language:
```
"Compare this Methods section to typical Nature Neuroscience standards.
Is it above average (8-10), average (6-7), or below average (1-5)?"
```

### Pitfall 2: Generic feedback without specifics
**Symptom**: AI says "improve clarity" without examples
**Solution**: Add to prompt:
```
"For each issue, provide:
- Exact location (section, paragraph)
- Specific problem (quote the problematic text)
- Concrete fix (before ‚Üí after example)"
```

### Pitfall 3: Student overwhelmed by too many issues
**Symptom**: 20+ issues, student doesn't know where to start
**Solution**: Instructor helps prioritize:
- Pick top 3 critical issues (those that lead to rejection)
- Ignore minor issues for now
- Focus on fixable problems (ignore "run another study" suggestions)

### Pitfall 4: AI suggests unrealistic fixes
**Symptom**: "Conduct a new study with N=500" when student has N=60
**Solution**: Reframe prompt:
```
"Given the existing data (N=60), how can I maximize rigor and transparency?
What analyses or reporting can I improve WITHOUT collecting new data?"
```

---

## Instructor Facilitation Notes

### Pre-Class Setup (10 min before class):
1. **Copy Figma template** for Week 5 AI Diagnostic Canvas
2. **Adjust student zones** (typically 6-12 zones for class size)
3. **Test AI prompts** yourself with a sample paper to ensure quality
4. **Prepare example** of good vs bad synthesis for demonstration

### During Class:

**Minutes 1-5**: Quick demo
- Show how to copy paper section ‚Üí paste into AI prompt ‚Üí record output
- Demonstrate one Reviewer 1 simulation live
- Answer questions about prompt usage

**Minutes 6-15**: Monitor & assist
- Watch student zones in real-time
- Identify students stuck (not filling out zones)
- Provide hints via Figma comments: "@StudentA - try adding your power analysis section to help AI evaluate sample size"
- React to good outputs with üëç emoji

**Minutes 16-20**: Highlight exemplars
- @mention students with particularly insightful syntheses
- Ask 2-3 students to share screen and walk through their synthesis
- Facilitate discussion: "Class, do you agree with this priority ranking?"

**Minutes 21-25**: Wrap-up
- Quick poll: "How many got Accept vs Revision vs Reject?"
- Pattern identification: "Most common critical issue in this class was ___"
- Transition: "Next activity is 3-Pass Revision to fix these issues systematically"

### Post-Class:
- **Export Figma to PDF** for student records
- **Identify class-wide patterns** (e.g., 80% had power analysis issues)
- **Update Recipe Library** with best reviewer prompts from students

## Example Student Work

### Exemplar: Student Zone A (Reviewer 1) Output

```
=== REVIEWER 1 SIMULATION ===

üì• INPUT:
- Methods: Sleep deprivation + memory consolidation (TMR during nap)
- Results: Selective consolidation for high-utility items

ü§ñ PROMPT USED: Reviewer 1 methodological rigor

üìä AI OUTPUT:
- Reproducibility: 9/10 (excellent detail on TMR protocol)
- Control strategy: 7/10 (good control group, but no sham TMR condition)
- Sample size/power: 8/10 (N=60, power=.85 for d=0.65)
- Statistical rigor: 9/10 (mixed-effects models, assumptions checked)
- Transparency: 8/10 (reported all outcomes, but didn't pre-register)
- AVERAGE: 8.2/10

‚úÖ DECISION: Minor Revision

üö® CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Add sham TMR condition to rule out auditory stimulation effects
2. Clarify blinding procedures (were scorers blind to condition?)

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ISSUES:
1. Consider pre-registering replication study
2. Add robustness checks (remove outliers, re-run)

üí° MY REACTION:
- Agree? YES - the sham TMR issue is real, I should address it
- Fixable? YES - can add sham analysis post-hoc from pilot data
- Priority: HIGH - will add to Discussion as limitation + future direction
```

**Why This Is Good**:
- ‚úÖ Specific scores with rationale
- ‚úÖ Clear critical vs important distinction
- ‚úÖ Student agrees and has a fix plan
- ‚úÖ Realistic about what's possible (can't rerun study, but can address in Discussion)

‚è±Ô∏è TOTAL ESTIMATED TIME: 13 hours (doable this week)

üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME:
- Current: Minor Revision (all 3 reviewers)
- After fixes: Accept (addressed all critical concerns)
- Justification: No fatal flaws, just missing pieces that are easy to add

üí° NEXT IMMEDIATE STEP:
Write sham TMR limitation paragraph in Discussion (30 min task)
```

**Why This Is Good**:
- ‚úÖ Clear consensus across reviewers (all said Minor Revision)
- ‚úÖ Identified common themes (not isolated complaints)
- ‚úÖ Realistic timeline (13 hours total)
- ‚úÖ Prioritized by impact (HIGH = affects decision, MED = improves paper, LOW = nice-to-have)
- ‚úÖ Concrete next step (not vague "improve paper")

## AI Prompt Variations for Different Journals

### For Nature/Science (strictest standards):
```
"You are a Reviewer 1 for Nature/Science - among the most selective journals
(acceptance rate <5%). Your standards are exceptionally high. Only groundbreaking
work with flawless methods should be Accepted. Be critical but fair."
```

### For Psychological Science (rigorous but field-specific):
```
"You are a Reviewer 1 for Psychological Science - a top psychology journal
emphasizing methodological rigor and replication. Focus on reproducibility,
power, and transparency. Accept rate ~10%."
```

### For specialized journals (JCCP, Cognition, etc.):
```
"You are a Reviewer 1 for [Journal Name] - a top [subfield] journal.
Evaluate with standards appropriate for this field (acceptance rate ~15-20%).
Be rigorous but recognize disciplinary norms."
```

**Instructor Tip**: Have students specify their target journal in the prompt for calibrated feedback.

## Integration with 3-Pass Revision (Next Activity)

**Handoff to Template 5.2**:

After completing AI Diagnostic Canvas, students will have:
- ‚úÖ Critical issues list (from 3 reviewers)
- ‚úÖ Prioritized action plan
- ‚úÖ Specific sections needing revision

This feeds directly into **3-Pass Revision Worksheet** (Template 5.2):
- **1st Pass (Macro)**: Fix structural issues flagged by Reviewer 3
- **2nd Pass (Meso)**: Fix section/paragraph issues flagged by Reviewers 1 & 2
- **3rd Pass (Micro)**: Fix sentence-level issues flagged by all reviewers

**Instructor Transition Script**:
> "Great! Now you know what to fix. The 3-Pass Revision strategy will help you fix these issues systematically. We'll start with big structural problems (Macro), then section problems (Meso), then sentence problems (Micro). This prevents you from polishing sentences in a paragraph you might delete later."

## Assessment Rubric (for instructors evaluating student work)

| Criterion | Excellent (5) | Good (4) | Acceptable (3) | Weak (2) | Insufficient (1) |
|-----------|---------------|----------|----------------|----------|------------------|
| **Completeness** | All 3 reviewers + synthesis done | 3 reviewers done, synthesis partial | 2 reviewers + partial synthesis | 1 reviewer only | None or minimal |
| **Specificity** | Exact issues with locations + quotes | Issues identified but general | Vague issues without examples | Too general to act on | Not specific at all |
| **Prioritization** | Clear Critical/Important/Minor + rationale | Good separation but weak rationale | Some prioritization, no rationale | No clear priorities | Random listing |
| **Actionability** | Concrete next steps with timeline | Next steps clear but no timeline | Vague next steps | Not actionable | No plan |
| **Realism** | Time estimates realistic, fixes feasible | Mostly realistic, minor overestimation | Some unrealistic fixes | Mostly unrealistic | Completely unrealistic |

**Target**: Students should score 4-5 (Good to Excellent) on all criteria.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Student's paper gets all "Reject" decisions
**Diagnosis**: Either paper has fundamental flaws OR AI is being too harsh
**Solution**:
1. Review the AI output - are criticisms valid?
2. If valid: Student needs major rethinking (consider switching to different research question)
3. If too harsh: Revise prompt to be more balanced, ask for "path to acceptance"

### Problem: Student's paper gets all "Accept" decisions
**Diagnosis**: Either paper is truly excellent OR AI is being too lenient
**Solution**:
1. Have student run Reviewer prompts again with stricter language: "Be hypercritical"
2. Instructor spot-check: Ask student to share paper, verify if it's really Accept-level
3. If truly excellent: Challenge student to aim for even higher-tier journal

### Problem: AI gives contradictory feedback (R1 says good, R2 says bad on same issue)
**Diagnosis**: Different reviewers focus on different aspects (this is realistic!)
**Solution**:
1. Teach student this is normal - real peer review also has contradictions
2. Use Reviewer 3 to arbitrate the disagreement
3. Student judgment call: Which concern is more valid for target journal?

### Problem: Student stuck on "what section to paste" for Reviewer 1
**Diagnosis**: Unclear instructions or student hasn't finished writing Methods/Results
**Solution**:
1. Provide clear guidance: "For Reviewer 1, paste your entire Methods section + Results section"
2. If sections incomplete: "Use what you have - feedback will help you complete it"
3. Minimum viable input: At least have Methods procedure + Results main analysis

## Pedagogical Rationale

### Why 3 Reviewers?
- **Real peer review uses 2-3 reviewers** - this simulates actual process
- **Triangulation** - convergent criticism is more credible than single opinion
- **Balanced feedback** - Reviewer 3 prevents overly harsh or lenient judgments

### Why AI Simulation Before Human Peer Review?
- **Immediate feedback** - no waiting for human reviewers
- **Unlimited iterations** - students can revise and re-simulate
- **Objective** - AI won't be influenced by personal relationships or fatigue
- **Prepares for real feedback** - students learn to handle criticism constructively

### Learning Outcomes:
1. **Self-assessment skill** - ability to see your work through critical lens
2. **Feedback integration** - synthesizing multiple perspectives
3. **Prioritization** - distinguishing critical from minor issues
4. **Action planning** - creating realistic improvement roadmap
5. **Resilience** - handling criticism without defensiveness
