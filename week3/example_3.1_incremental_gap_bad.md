# Example 3.1: Incremental Gap (❌ Bad Example)

**Purpose**: Show what an incremental gap looks like and why it's insufficient for top-tier journals

**Use in Workshop**: Reference example for Template 3.1 (Gap Discovery Canvas)

---

## Research Topic

**Domain**: Social Psychology - Conformity
**Student**: 가상 학생A (composite based on common patterns)

---

## Original Gap Statement

> "Previous studies on conformity have mostly used college students as participants. Our study will examine conformity in middle-aged adults (40-60 years old) to see if age makes a difference."

---

## Why This Is an Incremental Gap

### 1. Gap Type Classification

**AI Classification** (using Recipe #5):

```
Gap Type: ❌ INCREMENTAL

Reasoning:
- Simple population extension (college students → middle-aged adults)
- No new theoretical framework
- No mechanistic insight (doesn't explain HOW age affects conformity)
- Predictable outcome (likely: "conformity decreases with age")
```

**Manual Analysis**:
- ❌ Not **Conceptual**: No new way of thinking about conformity
- ❌ Not **Mechanistic**: Doesn't explain the process/mechanism
- ❌ Not **Translational**: Limited real-world application beyond description

**Bottom Line**: This is **population substitution**, not a genuine gap.

---

### 2. Three Tests Applied

#### Test 1: SURPRISE (놀라움) - ❌ FAIL

**Question**: "Is the prediction counterintuitive?"

**Prediction**: "Older adults will show less conformity than college students"

**Assessment**:
- ❌ **Expected finding**: Common sense + existing age-related research predicts this
- ❌ **No surprising implication**: Just confirms what everyone assumes
- ❌ **No theoretical challenge**: Doesn't contradict any assumption

**Analogy**: Like testing whether water is wet in different containers. The container doesn't change the water's properties fundamentally.

---

#### Test 2: CONSEQUENTIAL (영향력) - ❌ FAIL

**Question**: "Does this change theory or enable applications?"

**Theoretical Impact**:
- ❌ **No theory change**: Conformity theory remains the same
- ❌ **No new mechanism**: Still don't know WHY age matters
- ❌ **No paradigm shift**: Just adds a data point (age 40-60)

**Practical Impact**:
- ❌ **Limited application**: "Middle-aged people conform less" → So what?
- ❌ **No intervention**: Doesn't tell us how to reduce harmful conformity
- ❌ **No policy implication**: Age-based conformity differences don't drive decisions

**Stakeholder Assessment** (using Recipe #20):
```
AI Analysis:

Potential Stakeholders:
1. Lifespan development researchers
   - Impact: "Minor contribution to age norms database"
   - Action enabled: None (just descriptive data)

2. Organizational behavior (workplace conformity)
   - Impact: "Tangential relevance"
   - Action enabled: Unclear

Conclusion: Very limited stakeholder interest.
Impact Score: 2/5 (only specialists in lifespan norms might care)
```

---

#### Test 3: TRACTABLE (실현가능성) - ✅ PASS

**Question**: "Can this be tested with current methods?"

**Assessment**:
- ✅ **Methods established**: Asch conformity paradigm (1950s classic)
- ✅ **Sample accessible**: Middle-aged adults recruitable
- ✅ **Resources reasonable**: Standard behavioral study (~$5K, 3 months)

**But**: Feasibility alone is not enough! Many boring questions are feasible.

---

### Final Verdict

| Test | Score | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Surprise | 1/5 | ❌ FAIL |
| Consequential | 2/5 | ❌ FAIL |
| Tractable | 5/5 | ✅ PASS |
| **Overall** | **2.7/5** | **❌ INSUFFICIENT** |

**Decision**: ❌ **ABANDON or TRANSFORM** - Do NOT proceed with this gap as-is.

## How to Transform: Incremental → Conceptual

### Using Recipe #10 (Conceptual Gap Generator)

**Step 1: Identify the ASSUMPTION**
```
AI Prompt: "What does current conformity theory ASSUME about age effects?"

AI Response:
Current theories assume:
1. Conformity is driven by need to fit in (social acceptance)
2. Age reduces conformity because older adults care less about fitting in
3. Mechanism: Declining peer pressure sensitivity with age
```

**Step 2: Find a PUZZLE**
```
AI Prompt: "What does this assumption FAIL to explain?"

AI Response:
Puzzles:
1. Some older adults show HIGH conformity (e.g., in religious/political groups)
2. Conformity isn't just declining - it shifts DOMAINS (work → community)
3. Why do some cultures show INCREASING conformity with age?
```

**Step 3: Propose NEW FRAMEWORK**
```
AI Prompt: "What new framework could resolve this puzzle?"

AI Response:
New Framework: "Functional Shift Hypothesis"

Idea: Conformity doesn't decline with age - its FUNCTION changes.
- Young: Conformity = Fitting in (avoid rejection)
- Old: Conformity = Maintaining relationships (preserve bonds)

Mechanism: Social network changes (diffuse → dense long-term ties)
Prediction: Older adults conform MORE when it strengthens existing
            relationships, LESS when it's about impressing strangers.
```

**Step 4: Generate COUNTERINTUITIVE PREDICTION**
```
Counterintuitive prediction:
"Older adults will show HIGHER conformity than young adults when
the group consists of long-term friends, but LOWER conformity when
the group consists of strangers."

This challenges the simple "conformity declines with age" assumption.
```

---

### Better Version (Conceptual Gap)

**Transformed Gap Statement**:

> "Previous studies show conformity declines with age, but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesize that age-related changes in social network structure (dense, long-term relationships vs. diffuse, short-term ones) fundamentally alter the **function** of conformity from 'fitting in' (avoiding rejection) to 'maintaining bonds' (preserving relationships).
>
> Using social network analysis + behavioral conformity tasks, we will test whether older adults show **higher** conformity in long-term relationship contexts (vs. young adults) but **lower** conformity in stranger contexts. This predicts a **crossover interaction** (age × relationship type), demonstrating that conformity serves different adaptive functions across the lifespan."

### What Changed?

| Element | Original (Incremental) | Transformed (Conceptual) |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Core claim** | "Age affects conformity" | "Conformity's FUNCTION changes with age" |
| **Theoretical contribution** | None (just adds data point) | Functional Shift Hypothesis (new framework) |
| **Prediction** | Predictable (less conformity) | Counterintuitive (MORE conformity with friends) |
| **Mechanism** | Unspecified | Social network structure → functional shift |
| **Test** | Simple age comparison | Crossover interaction (age × context) |
| **Surprise Test** | FAIL (expected finding) | PASS (counterintuitive prediction) |
| **Consequential Test** | FAIL (no theory change) | PASS (new framework + mechanism) |
| **Journal tier** | Low (e.g., regional journal) | High (e.g., Psychological Science, JPSP) |

## Red Flags for Incremental Gaps

### Warning Signs (If you see these, you likely have an incremental gap)

1. **"Previous studies used X, we'll use Y"**
   - ⚠️ Population substitution (X=students, Y=adults)
   - ⚠️ Method substitution (X=lab, Y=field)
   - ⚠️ Context substitution (X=US, Y=Korea)

2. **"Limited research on [demographic]"**
   - ⚠️ "No studies on middle-aged adults"
   - ⚠️ "Few studies in Asian populations"
   - ⚠️ Unless: You have theoretical reason WHY this matters

3. **"We will be the first to..."**
   - ⚠️ Risky claim - often false after literature search
   - ⚠️ Even if true, "first" ≠ "important"

4. **"We will explore/examine/investigate..."**
   - ⚠️ Vague exploratory language
   - ⚠️ No specific hypothesis or prediction

### Self-Check Questions

Ask yourself:
- ❓ If I removed the population/context difference, would this still be interesting?
  - If NO → Incremental gap
- ❓ Can I articulate WHY this population/context matters theoretically?
  - If NO → Incremental gap
- ❓ Does my prediction surprise me (and would it surprise the field)?
  - If NO → Incremental gap
- ❓ Does my gap propose a NEW WAY to think about the phenomenon (not just new data)?
  - If NO → Incremental gap

## Practice Exercise

### Your Turn

**Take YOUR research gap**. Apply the Red Flag Detector:

1. Write your gap in one sentence
2. Check: Does it match any red flag pattern above?
3. If YES: Use Recipe #10 to transform it
4. If NO: Verify with Recipe #5 (Gap Type Classifier)

### Transformation Template

If you detect an incremental gap, use this template:

**Original** (Incremental):
"Previous studies used [X], we will use [Y]."

**Transform to** (Conceptual):
"Current theory assumes [ASSUMPTION]. This fails to explain [PUZZLE]. We propose [NEW FRAMEWORK]: [MECHANISM]. Using [METHOD], we will test [COUNTERINTUITIVE PREDICTION], proving [THEORETICAL CLAIM]."

**Applied to conformity example**:
- ASSUMPTION: Conformity declines with age (less peer pressure)
- PUZZLE: Some older adults show high conformity
- NEW FRAMEWORK: Functional Shift Hypothesis
- MECHANISM: Social network structure changes → conformity function changes
- PREDICTION: Higher conformity with friends (not lower!)
- THEORETICAL CLAIM: Conformity serves different functions across lifespan

## Pedagogical Notes

### For Instructors

**Teaching Points**:
1. **Normalize the mistake**: Most students start with incremental gaps - that's OK!
2. **Emphasize early detection**: Better to catch this in Week 3 than after 6 months of data collection
3. **Show transformation**: Incremental gaps can often be elevated to conceptual with proper framing
4. **Use real examples**: If possible, show actual incremental gaps from student work (anonymized)

**Common Student Reactions**:
- "But this feels like wasted work!" → No! You learned to recognize incremental gaps
- "My advisor said this is interesting" → Advisors sometimes overestimate novelty; validation is essential
- "Can't I just add a measure?" → Adding variables doesn't fix incremental gaps

**Calibration Activity**:
- Show 5 gap statements (mix of incremental + conceptual)
- Students classify each → Discuss → Calibrate standards
