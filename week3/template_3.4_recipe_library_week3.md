# Template 3.4: Recipe Library (Week 3 Cumulative)

**Week 3 - Research Gap Discovery & Validation**
**Activity**: Curate and share best AI prompt recipes (embedded in Templates 3.1-3.3)
**Format**: Bottom section of main canvas + Standalone export

---

## Purpose

**Cumulative Recipe Library** collects the best AI prompt recipes discovered during Week 3 workshops. This creates a growing knowledge base that:
- Captures student innovations (not just lecture recipes)
- Enables peer learning (students see what works)
- Builds across weeks (Week 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6)
- Provides templates for future students

---

## Recipe Library Structure

### Location in Figma

**Embedded** in all Week 3 templates:
- Template 3.1 (Gap Discovery Canvas): Bottom section
- Template 3.2 (3-Stage Validation): Reference panel
- Template 3.3 (Peer Review): Success examples

**Standalone Export**:
- PDF at end of Week 3
- Linked from Week 4-6 canvases

- Monitor student work in real-time
- React with 🔥 emoji on excellent prompts
- Note innovations (variations not in lecture notes)

**Step 2: Nominate (last 5 min)**
- Instructor highlights 2-3 best recipes
- Brief explanation: "Why is this excellent?"
- Student who created it explains their thinking

**Step 3: Vote (if time allows)**
- Class votes: ⭐ rating (1-5)
- Quick show of hands or Figma reactions
- Top-voted recipes featured prominently

**Step 4: Document (after class)**
- Instructor fills recipe card
- Adds to library section
- Exports as PDF

---

### Quality Criteria

**Excellent Recipe (5 stars)**:
- ✅ Novel variation (not just copy-paste from lecture)
- ✅ Specific use case (not vague "gap discovery")
- ✅ Demonstrated results (worked for student)
- ✅ Transferable (others can apply it)
- ✅ Explains "why it works" (not just "it works")

**Good Recipe (4 stars)**:
- Meets 3-4 of above criteria
- Useful but minor novelty

**Include in Library**:
- All 5-star recipes (featured prominently)
- Selected 4-star recipes (if space allows)

│ 📝 Use Case:                                                 │
│ When your gap feels incremental, use this to find a paradox │
│ that challenges existing theories → instant conceptual gap. │
│                                                              │

│ Find a PARADOX:                                              │
│ 1. Search for empirical findings that CONTRADICT            │
│    those assumptions                                         │
│ 2. Identify: "Everyone thinks X, but data shows Y"          │
│ 3. Explain: Why is this paradox unresolved?                 │
│ 4. Propose: What new framework could resolve it?            │
│                                                              │
│ Format your answer:                                          │
│ "PARADOX: Despite [assumption X], we observe [finding Y].   │
│  Current theory cannot explain this because [reason].       │
│  A new framework based on [mechanism] could resolve it."    │

│                                                              │
│ 💡 Why It Works:                                             │
│ Paradoxes are inherently surprising (counterintuitive) and  │
│ consequential (require theory revision). By starting with   │
│ paradox, you guarantee a conceptual gap, not incremental.   │
│                                                              │
│ 📊 Results Example:                                          │
│ • Input: "Sleep and memory" (initial gap: incremental)      │
│ • Output: "PARADOX: Despite sleep improving memory on       │
│   average, 20% of people show WORSE memory after sleep.     │
│   Current consolidation theory can't explain individual     │
│   differences. A utility-based framework could resolve it." │
│ • Outcome: Transformed incremental gap → conceptual         │
│            (became Nature Neuroscience submission)          │
│                                                              │

│ • Use BEFORE Recipe #10 (to generate framework)             │
