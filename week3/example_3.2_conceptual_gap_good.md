## Gap Statement

> "Current memory consolidation theory assumes sleep-dependent replay strengthens memories uniformly based on encoding strength. However, this fails to explain why some strongly-encoded memories fade despite sleep, while weakly-encoded memories sometimes strengthen. We propose a **'selective consolidation' framework**: sleep replay prioritizes memories with **high future utility** (predicted by goal-relevance and environmental context), not just high encoding strength.
>
> Using closed-loop targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during sleep + real-time decoding of hippocampal replay, we will test whether artificially biasing replay toward **low-utility memories** can restore their consolidation, proving that **utility-prediction (not encoding strength) causally drives selective consolidation**."

---

## Why This Is a Conceptual Gap

### 1. Gap Type Classification

**AI Classification** (using Recipe #5):

```
Gap Type: ✅ CONCEPTUAL (also Mechanistic)

Reasoning:
- NEW THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: Shifts from "strength-based" to "utility-based"
  consolidation theory
- CHALLENGES CORE ASSUMPTION: Current theory assumes encoding strength →
  consolidation; this proposes utility → consolidation
- MECHANISTIC INSIGHT: Proposes sleep replay as adaptive selection process
  (not passive strengthening)
- CAUSAL TEST: Closed-loop manipulation proves causality (not just correlation)

Classification Confidence: 95%
```

**Manual Analysis**:
- ✅ **Conceptual**: Proposes entirely new framework (utility-based selection)
- ✅ **Mechanistic**: Explains HOW consolidation works (utility prediction during replay)
- ✅ **Translational**: Enables targeted interventions (education, therapy)

---

### 2. Three Tests Applied

#### Test 1: SURPRISE (놀라움) - ✅ PASS (5/5)

**Question**: "Is the prediction counterintuitive?"

**Predictions**:
1. **Counterintuitive Prediction #1**:
   - Current theory: Strong encoding → consolidation
   - Our prediction: **Weak encoding + high utility → consolidation**
   - Surprise: Weakly-encoded memory can outcompete strongly-encoded one!

2. **Counterintuitive Prediction #2**:
   - Current theory: More replay → better consolidation
   - Our prediction: **Low-utility replay (even if frequent) → no consolidation**
   - Surprise: Replay amount doesn't matter if utility is low!

3. **Counterintuitive Prediction #3** (manipulation):
   - If we **artificially boost replay** of low-utility memories → they consolidate
   - Proves: Replay is sufficient, encoding strength is not necessary

**Assessment**:
- ✅ **Challenges dominant theory**: "Strength-based consolidation"
- ✅ **Predicts reversals**: Weak > Strong (under certain conditions)
- ✅ **Testable surprise**: Closed-loop TMR provides causal test

**AI Surprise Score** (using Recipe #5):
```
Surprise Assessment: 5/5

Justification:
- Reverses field consensus (encoding strength primacy)
- Generates novel empirical predictions (crossover interactions)
- Resolves existing paradoxes (why some strong memories fade)
```

---

#### Test 2: CONSEQUENTIAL (영향력) - ✅ PASS (5/5)

**Question**: "Does this change theory or enable applications?"

**Theoretical Impact**:
- ✅ **Theory change**: Consolidation as **adaptive selection** (not passive strengthening)
- ✅ **Paradigm shift**: From "what's encoded strongly?" to "what's useful in future?"
- ✅ **Cross-domain**: Connects memory, decision-making, predictive processing
- ✅ **Resolves puzzles**: Explains individual differences in consolidation

**Practical Impact** (using Recipe #20 - Stakeholder Identifier):

```
AI Stakeholder Analysis:

1. EDUCATION (teachers, students):
   Action: Prioritize high-utility content (exam-relevant) before sleep
   Impact: Optimize study schedules for selective consolidation

2. CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY (PTSD therapists):
   Action: Suppress trauma memory replay by reducing perceived utility
   Impact: New intervention target (utility perception, not encoding strength)

3. SKILL LEARNING (sports coaches, musicians):
   Action: Enhance consolidation of rate-limiting sub-skills
   Impact: Targeted practice + sleep optimization

4. AGING RESEARCH (cognitive decline prevention):
   Action: Compensate for declining consolidation by boosting utility signals
   Impact: Maintain memory despite biological aging

Impact Score: 5/5
- Multiple stakeholders (4+)
- Specific actions enabled (not vague)
- Both theoretical AND practical impact
```

## 3-Stage Validation Applied

### Stage 1: Cross-Disciplinary Search (Novelty Check)

**AI Search** (Recipe #15):

```
Query: Search AI/ML, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology for:
- "utility-based memory selection"
- "goal-relevant consolidation"
- "adaptive replay"

FINDINGS:

Adjacent Field 1: REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (AI/ML)
- Existing work: "Prioritized experience replay" (Schaul et al., 2016, ICLR)
  → Selects high-TD-error transitions for replay
  → Conceptually similar: utility-based selection
- Gap remaining: NOT applied to biological sleep consolidation

Adjacent Field 2: COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE
- Existing work: Replay models focus on encoding strength (e.g., Diba & Buzsáki, 2007)
- Gap remaining: No models incorporate future utility prediction

Adjacent Field 3: DECISION NEUROSCIENCE
- Existing work: vmPFC encodes future value (Bartra et al., 2013)
- Gap remaining: Not linked to sleep replay mechanisms

NOVELTY ASSESSMENT:
- Concept exists in AI: YES (prioritized replay)
- Applied to biological sleep: NO
- Causal test in humans: NO
- Unique angle: Cross-disciplinary inspiration (RL → neuroscience)

Novelty Score: 4/5
```

**Why not 5/5?**
- The concept (prioritized replay) exists in AI/ML
- But: Application to biological consolidation is novel
- But: Causal test (closed-loop TMR) is novel

**Interpretation**: ✅ Novel enough for top-tier journals (cross-disciplinary novelty)

**Impact Score**: 5/5
- 4 stakeholder groups
- Specific actions for each
- Both theory and practice

---

### Stage 3: Feasibility Check (Tractability)

**See "Tractable Test" above** - already assessed.

**Feasibility Score**: 4/5
- All methods established
- Resource-intensive but achievable
- Clear mitigation for barriers

## Gap Statement Anatomy

Let's dissect why this gap statement works:

```
"Current memory consolidation theory assumes sleep-dependent replay
strengthens memories uniformly based on encoding strength."
```
→ **PROBLEM**: States current assumption clearly

```
"However, this fails to explain why some strongly-encoded memories
fade despite sleep, while weakly-encoded memories sometimes strengthen."
```
→ **PUZZLE**: Identifies empirical paradox that assumption can't explain

```
"We propose a 'selective consolidation' framework: sleep replay
prioritizes memories with high future utility (predicted by
goal-relevance and environmental context), not just high encoding strength."
```
→ **FRAMEWORK**: Names the new theoretical framework + mechanism

```
"Using closed-loop targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during sleep +
real-time decoding of hippocampal replay,"
```
→ **METHOD**: Specifies precise approach (shows feasibility)

```
"we will test whether artificially biasing replay toward low-utility
memories can restore their consolidation,"
```
→ **PREDICTION**: Counterintuitive, testable prediction

```
"proving that utility-prediction (not encoding strength) causally drives
selective consolidation."
```
→ **CLAIM**: Causal claim (not just correlation)

## Comparison: Incremental vs Conceptual

| Element | Incremental Gap (Example 3.1) | Conceptual Gap (This Example) |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Opening** | "Previous studies used X" | "Current theory assumes..." |
| **Gap claim** | "We will use Y" | "This fails to explain [puzzle]" |
| **Framework** | None (implicit) | Explicit ("selective consolidation framework") |
| **Mechanism** | Unspecified | Specified (utility prediction during replay) |
| **Prediction** | Expected (age ↓ conformity) | Counterintuitive (utility > strength) |
| **Test** | Correlation (age × conformity) | Causal manipulation (TMR boost) |
| **Impact** | Descriptive (demographic norms) | Theoretical + Practical (4 stakeholders) |
| **Journal tier** | Low (regional) | High (Nature Neuroscience) |

## Transformation Template

If you have an incremental gap, use this structure:

**Structure**:
1. **Current theory assumes**: [ASSUMPTION]
2. **This fails to explain**: [PUZZLE]
3. **We propose**: [FRAMEWORK NAME]: [MECHANISM]
4. **Using**: [METHOD]
5. **We will test whether**: [COUNTERINTUITIVE PREDICTION]
6. **Proving**: [CAUSAL CLAIM]

**Applied to this example**:
1. ASSUMPTION: Encoding strength → consolidation
2. PUZZLE: Strong memories fade, weak memories strengthen (paradox)
3. FRAMEWORK: Selective consolidation via utility prediction
4. METHOD: Closed-loop TMR + replay decoding
5. PREDICTION: Low-utility replay boost → consolidation
6. CLAIM: Utility-prediction drives consolidation (causally)
