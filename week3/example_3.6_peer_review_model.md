**Purpose**: Show what excellent peer review looks like for gap discovery work

**Use in Workshop**: Model for Template 3.3 (Peer Review Rubric) - demonstrates balanced, constructive feedback

---

## Context

**Reviewer**: ÌïôÏÉùA
**Reviewee**: ÌïôÏÉùB
**Gap Topic**: Procrastination and task features (from comprehensive plan Example 3.6)

---

## Student B's Work (Being Reviewed)

### Gap Statement

"Current theories of procrastination focus on trait-level factors (e.g., conscientiousness, impulsivity), but fail to explain why the same person procrastinates on some tasks but not others. We propose a 'task-aversion' framework: procrastination is driven by anticipatory negative affect toward specific task features (e.g., ambiguity, difficulty, boredom), not by stable personality traits. Using experience sampling (ESM) to track within-person variation in task features and procrastination, we will test whether task-level aversion predicts procrastination beyond trait-level predictors, proving that procrastination is context-dependent, not trait-determined."

### 3-Stage Validation Results

**Stage 1: Novelty** - Score: 4/5
- Cross-disciplinary search found: Organizational behavior literature on "task characteristics" (Hackman & Oldham, 1976), but not linked to procrastination
- Novelty: Applying task features to procrastination (previously trait-focused field)

**Stage 2: Impact** - Score: 5/5
- Stakeholders: Students, educators, workplace productivity
- Translational: Task redesign (reduce ambiguity, add structure) to prevent procrastination
- Theoretical: Shifts focus from "who procrastinates" to "what triggers procrastination"

**Stage 3: Feasibility** - Score: 4/5
- Method: Experience sampling (ESM) - established
- Challenge: Requires high-frequency data collection (5x/day for 2 weeks)
- Mitigation: Mobile app with reminders

**Overall Validation**: ‚úÖ PASS (4.3/5 average)

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Gap Quality: 5/5 (40% weight = 2.0)

#### ‚úÖ Strengths

**Conceptual Contribution**:
This is NOT just "task features matter" (which would be incremental). Instead, you propose that procrastination is **context-dependent, not trait-determined** - this is a paradigm shift. Excellent!

**Specific Examples of Excellence**:

1. **Problem Articulation** (lines 1-2):
   - "Current theories focus on traits, but fail to explain within-person variation"
   - ‚úÖ This clearly identifies the limitation of existing theories (not just "gap exists")
   - ‚úÖ The word "fail to explain" is stronger than "limited research on"

2. **Framework Naming** (line 3):
   - "Task-aversion framework"
   - ‚úÖ Gives your contribution a memorable name (will be citable as "the task-aversion framework")
   - ‚úÖ Much better than vague "we will examine task effects"

3. **Testable Prediction** (lines 6-8):
   - "Task-level aversion predicts procrastination BEYOND trait predictors"
   - ‚úÖ This is specific and falsifiable (hierarchical regression testable)
   - ‚úÖ The word "BEYOND" shows you're testing incremental validity (sophisticated!)

4. **Surprise Test** (implicit):
   - Prediction: Same person varies in procrastination across tasks
   - ‚úÖ This challenges the trait assumption (traits = stable across situations)
   - ‚úÖ Counterintuitive: High-conscientiousness person CAN procrastinate (on certain tasks)

**Why This Deserves 5/5**:
- Conceptual gap (not incremental)
- Surprising (challenges trait psychology)
- Consequential (shifts intervention from "fix the person" to "fix the task")
- Clear boundaries (focuses on anticipatory affect, not post-task regret)

---

#### üí≠ Minor Suggestions for Perfection

**Suggestion #1**: Specify which task features (optional refinement)

Current: "task features (e.g., ambiguity, difficulty, boredom)"
- Are these the main 3? Or just examples?

Possible revision:
- "We focus on three meta-analytically supported aversions (Steel, 2007): ambiguity (unclear goals), difficulty (low self-efficacy), and boredom (low intrinsic interest)."

**Why**: Citing Steel (2007) shows you're not picking features randomly, but building on meta-analytic evidence. Also clarifies these are THE 3 (not just examples).

**Impact if added**: Gap Quality would stay 5/5, but grant reviewers would appreciate the precision

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Validation Thoroughness: 4/5 (30% weight = 1.2)

#### ‚úÖ Strengths

**All 3 Stages Completed**: ‚úÖ
- Stage 1: Cross-disciplinary search (Hackman & Oldham, 1976 from org behavior)
- Stage 2: Stakeholder analysis (students, educators, workplaces)
- Stage 3: Feasibility check (ESM method, mitigation for compliance)

**Evidence-Based Scoring**:
- Novelty 4/5: Justified (components exist, but integration is novel)
- Impact 5/5: Justified (3 stakeholders with specific actions)
- Feasibility 4/5: Justified (method established, but data collection demanding)

**Cross-Disciplinary Depth** (Stage 1):
- Excellent! You found Hackman & Oldham (1976) from organizational behavior
- This shows thorough search beyond psychology journals

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Strengthening

**Stage 1 - Novelty Check**: 4/5 ‚Üí Could be 5/5 with one more step

**Question**: You found Hackman & Oldham (1976) studied task characteristics in **motivation**. Did they specifically link task characteristics to **procrastination**? Or just general motivation?

**Why it matters**:
- If they studied motivation broadly (not procrastination), your novelty is STRONGER
- If they studied procrastination specifically, you'd need to clarify your unique angle

**Suggested AI Follow-Up** (Recipe #16):
```
Search specifically for:
"task characteristics" AND "procrastination"
"task features" AND "delay behavior"

Goal: Confirm no one has directly tested task-level variation in procrastination
```

**Expected outcome**:
- Likely: No direct tests of task characteristics ‚Üí procrastination
- This would boost novelty from 4/5 ‚Üí 5/5 (even stronger claim)

---

**Stage 3 - Feasibility Challenge**: Minor gap

**Your statement**: "ESM 5x/day for 2 weeks, mobile app with reminders"

**Missing**: Sample size justification

**Question**: How many participants do you need for multilevel modeling (within-person effects)?

**Suggested Addition**:
- "Power analysis (Snijders & Bosker, 2012) suggests N=40 participants √ó 70 observations (5/day √ó 14 days) provides 80% power to detect medium within-person effects (d=0.3)"

**Why this matters**:
- Shows you've thought about statistical power (not just "ESM is feasible")
- Reviewers WILL ask this (preempt the question)

**Impact**: Would boost Validation Thoroughness from 4/5 ‚Üí 5/5

---

#### üí° What Would Make This Stage 5/5?

Add two things:
1. **Novelty verification**: Confirm task characteristics NOT tested in procrastination (see Recipe #16 suggestion above)
2. **Power analysis**: Specify N needed for within-person multilevel models

**Time investment**: 30 minutes (15 min AI search + 15 min power calculation)
**Payoff**: Strengthens Stage 1 and Stage 3, overall validation ‚Üí 5/5

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Gap Statement Clarity: 5/5 (20% weight = 1.0)

#### ‚úÖ Strengths

**Structure**: Problem ‚Üí Framework ‚Üí Method ‚Üí Prediction ‚Üí Claim
- ‚úÖ Perfect IMRaD-style gap statement (could go straight into grant proposal)

**Specificity**:
- ‚úÖ "Within-person variation" (not vague "individual differences")
- ‚úÖ "Anticipatory negative affect" (not generic "emotions")
- ‚úÖ "Beyond trait-level predictors" (hierarchical test, not simple correlation)

**Conciseness**:
- ‚úÖ One paragraph (119 words)
- ‚úÖ Dense but readable (each sentence adds new info)

**Testability**:
- ‚úÖ "Predicts procrastination beyond trait predictors" ‚Üí Hierarchical regression testable immediately
- ‚úÖ Clear DV (procrastination), IV (task aversion), covariates (trait predictors)

---

#### üí≠ Exemplary Elements

1. **Opening Contrast** (lines 1-2):
   - "Current theories focus on X, but fail to explain Y"
   - ‚úÖ This is the GOLD STANDARD opening (used in Nature/Science papers)

2. **Framework Naming** (line 3):
   - "We propose [framework name]"
   - ‚úÖ Gives your contribution identity (memorable, citable)

3. **Operational Definition** (lines 5-6):
   - "Using experience sampling (ESM) to track within-person variation"
   - ‚úÖ Operationalizes the test (shows feasibility immediately)

4. **Causal Language** (line 8):
   - "Proving that procrastination is context-dependent, not trait-determined"
   - ‚úÖ Strong causal claim (within-person design supports this)

---

#### üí≠ Optional Enhancement for Top-Tier Journal

**Current**: Gap statement is excellent as-is

**For Nature Human Behaviour / PNAS**: Add "broader significance" sentence at end

**Example Addition**:
"This context-dependent view of procrastination could transform interventions from trait-based counseling to evidence-based task design, with applications in education (assignment structure), workplace productivity (project management), and mental health (behavioral activation)."

**Why**:
- Top journals want "so what?" even in gap statement
- Shows translational impact upfront (not just theory)

**Impact**: Clarity stays 5/5, but signals "high-impact journal" awareness

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ AI Tool Usage: 5/5 (10% weight = 0.5)

#### ‚úÖ Strengths

**Strategic Recipe Selection**:
- ‚úÖ Used Recipe #16 (Cross-Disciplinary Gap Finder) for Stage 1 - appropriate!
- ‚úÖ Correctly identified organizational behavior as adjacent field (not just psych)

**Effective Prompting**:
- ‚úÖ Search query: "task characteristics" ‚Üí Found Hackman & Oldham (1976)
- ‚úÖ Specific enough to find relevant work, broad enough to discover cross-domain connections

**Critical Evaluation**:
- ‚úÖ You DIDN'T just accept AI classification blindly
- ‚úÖ You noted: "Hackman & Oldham studied motivation, not procrastination specifically"
- ‚úÖ This shows critical thinking (not just trusting AI)

---

#### üí≠ Exemplary Practices

1. **Specificity in Prompts**:
   - You specified "task features (ambiguity, difficulty, boredom)" in your prompt
   - ‚úÖ This helped AI find relevant papers (more focused search)

2. **Acknowledging Limitations**:
   - You noted: "not linked to procrastination" (Hackman & Oldham gap)
   - ‚úÖ Shows you distinguish "related work" from "exact gap addressed"

3. **Appropriate Recipe Choice**:
   - Recipe #16 is perfect for Stage 1 (cross-disciplinary novelty check)
   - Could also use Recipe #20 for Stage 2 (Stakeholder Identifier) - did you?

---

#### üí≠ Suggested Next AI Steps (to strengthen validation)

**For Stage 2 (Impact)**: Try Recipe #21
```
Recipe #21: Translational Pathway Mapper

Prompt:
My finding: "Procrastination is driven by task-level aversion (ambiguity,
difficulty, boredom), not traits."

Map specific translational pathways:
1. Education: How do educators redesign assignments?
2. Workplace: How do managers restructure projects?
3. Clinical: How do therapists target procrastination?

For each, provide 2-3 specific actionable interventions.
```

**Expected output**: More concrete actions than "task redesign"
- e.g., "Education: Use rubrics to reduce ambiguity, scaffold difficult tasks"

**Impact**: Would make Stage 2 even stronger (5/5 ‚Üí 5+/5 with stellar examples)

---

**For Stage 3 (Feasibility)**: Try Recipe #27
```
Recipe #27: Statistical Power Estimator

Prompt:
My design: ESM, 5 observations/day √ó 14 days = 70 obs/person
Analysis: Multilevel model (within-person task aversion ‚Üí procrastination)
Expected effect: Medium (d=0.3 within-person)

Calculate: Sample size needed for 80% power?
Reference: Snijders & Bosker (2012) formulas or simr package in R
```

**Expected output**: "N=40 provides 80% power"

**Impact**: Would address my concern about missing power analysis (4/5 ‚Üí 5/5)

---

## üéØ Top 3 Priority Actions

### For Student B (to strengthen this excellent gap)

**1. [HIGH PRIORITY] Verify novelty vs. Hackman & Oldham (1976)**

**Action**: Run AI search (Recipe #16)
```
Search: "task characteristics" AND "procrastination"
Goal: Confirm H&O studied motivation broadly, NOT procrastination specifically
```

**Rationale**: If confirmed, your novelty score goes from 4/5 ‚Üí 5/5

**Contingency**: If someone HAS tested task characteristics ‚Üí procrastination:
- Emphasize YOUR unique angle: "anticipatory affect" mechanism
- Add: "Previous work correlated task features with delay; we test WITHIN-PERSON dynamics"

**Time**: 15 minutes

---

**2. [MEDIUM PRIORITY] Add power analysis to Stage 3**

**Action**: Calculate sample size for multilevel model

**Resources**:
- Snijders & Bosker (2012) formulas
- Or use `simr` package in R
- Or simpler: "N=40 participants √ó 70 obs = 2800 data points (adequate for MLM)"

**Expected addition to gap statement** (feasibility section):
"Power analysis suggests N=40 participants provides 80% power to detect medium within-person effects (d=0.3)."

**Impact**: Strengthens feasibility claim, preempts reviewer question

**Time**: 30 minutes (or ask a stats-savvy colleague)

---

**3. [LOW PRIORITY - OPTIONAL] Cite Steel (2007) for task features**

**Action**: Add citation for why you chose ambiguity/difficulty/boredom

**Current**: "task features (e.g., ambiguity, difficulty, boredom)"

**Enhanced**: "task features (Steel, 2007 meta-analysis: ambiguity, difficulty, boredom)"

**Impact**: Shows evidence-based selection (not arbitrary choice)

**Why LOW priority**: Gap is already excellent; this just adds polish

**Time**: 5 minutes (find Steel, 2007 meta-analysis on procrastination)

## üí° Lessons for All Students

### ‚úÖ What to Learn from This Example (Do This!)

1. **Framework Naming**: "Task-aversion framework" is memorable, citable
   - YOUR turn: Can you name YOUR framework?

2. **Hierarchical Testing**: "Beyond trait predictors" shows sophisticated thinking
   - YOUR turn: Can you test YOUR predictor "beyond" existing ones?

3. **Cross-Disciplinary Search**: Found Hackman & Oldham from org behavior
   - YOUR turn: What adjacent fields might have studied YOUR topic?

4. **Critical AI Use**: Didn't blindly trust AI; noted "not linked to procrastination"
   - YOUR turn: Are you critically evaluating AI outputs?

5. **Within-Person Design**: ESM captures person varying across situations
   - YOUR turn: Can YOUR question benefit from within-person variation?

---

### ‚ùå What to Avoid (Common Pitfalls)

1. **Vague Gap Statements**: ‚ùå "We will study task factors"
   - ‚úÖ Instead: "We propose task-aversion framework"

2. **Ignoring Feasibility**: ‚ùå "ESM is feasible" (no detail)
   - ‚úÖ Instead: "N=40, 5 obs/day, mobile app, 80% power"

3. **Accepting AI Uncritically**: ‚ùå "AI said it's novel, so it must be"
   - ‚úÖ Instead: "AI found H&O, but they studied motivation, not procrastination specifically"

4. **Skipping Power Analysis**: ‚ùå "We'll collect data and see"
   - ‚úÖ Instead: "Power analysis: N=40 for d=0.3"

## üéì Transferable Strategies

### Strategy #1: Framework Naming

**What**: Give your contribution a memorable name

**Examples from This Review**:
- "Task-aversion framework" (this gap)
- "Selective consolidation framework" (Example 3.2)
- "Functional shift hypothesis" (Example 3.1 transformed)

**YOUR Application**:
- What is YOUR framework called? (not "my study" or "this research")

---

### Strategy #2: Hierarchical Testing

**What**: Test your predictor "BEYOND" established predictors

**Formula**: "X predicts Y beyond [established predictor]"

**Examples**:
- Task aversion predicts procrastination beyond trait conscientiousness
- Utility predicts consolidation beyond encoding strength
- Social network predicts conformity beyond age

**YOUR Application**:
- What's the established predictor in YOUR field?
- Can you test YOUR predictor "beyond" it?

---

### Strategy #3: Cross-Disciplinary Inspiration

**What**: Search adjacent fields for novel connections

**Examples**:
- Procrastination ‚Üê Org behavior (Hackman & Oldham)
- Memory consolidation ‚Üê Reinforcement learning (prioritized replay)
- Conformity ‚Üê Social network analysis (dense vs. diffuse ties)

**YOUR Application**:
- List 3 adjacent fields to YOUR topic
- Run AI search (Recipe #15) for each

---

### Strategy #4: Mitigation Plans

**What**: For every feasibility challenge, propose a solution

**Formula**: "Challenge: [X]. Mitigation: [Y]."

**Examples**:
- Challenge: ESM compliance. Mitigation: Mobile app + incentives.
- Challenge: fMRI motion. Mitigation: Strict QC + multi-session scans.
- Challenge: Sample size. Mitigation: Power analysis justifies N=40.

**YOUR Application**:
- What's YOUR biggest feasibility challenge?
- What's a concrete mitigation (with precedent)?

## üìö Recipe Contribution

### Student A's Contribution to Recipe Library

**New Recipe Discovered**: "Within-Person Variation Detector"

```markdown
Recipe #31: Within-Person Variation Detector (for challenging trait theories)

Purpose: Test whether a trait-level theory actually explains within-person variation

Prompt:
"Current theory X explains outcome Y using trait-level predictor Z.

However, can this theory explain why the SAME PERSON shows DIFFERENT levels of Y
across situations?

Search for:
1. Studies testing within-person variation in Y
2. Situational moderators of the X‚ÜíY relationship
3. Alternative frameworks emphasizing context over traits

Identify: What gap exists in explaining within-person dynamics?"

When to Use:
- When challenging trait-based theories
- When proposing context-dependent mechanisms
- When designing ESM or diary studies

Expected Output:
- Confirmation that trait theory assumes between-person differences only
- Evidence (or lack thereof) for within-person tests
- Potential situational factors unexplored

Example Application:
- Applied to procrastination: Revealed trait theories ignore task-level variation
- Led to task-aversion framework proposal
- Generated within-person ESM design
```

**Predicted Rating**: 4-5 stars (highly transferable to other domains)
