### Examples (3,630 lines total for 2 examples, ~1,815 lines each)

#### Example 5.1: Paper Before AI Diagnostic (1,920 lines)
**Purpose**: Show complete realistic student paper with multi-level problems

**Paper Details**:
- **Topic**: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for College Student Anxiety
- **Target Journal**: Psychological Science (top-tier)
- **Structure**: Complete paper (Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References)
- **Word Count**: ~8,000 words total

**Problems Embedded** (Multi-Level):

**MACRO Problems**:
1. Message drift (Title: "reduces" vs Discussion: "can be effective")
2. Gap-Method mismatch (Introduction suggests mechanistic, Methods only tests effectiveness)
3. Inverted pyramid (Introduction 43%, Results 21% - should be balanced)

**MESO Problems**:
4. Introduction Paragraph 1 doing 3 jobs (should split)
5. Old→New flow violations in Paragraph 3
6. Methods subsections lack topic sentences

**MICRO Problems**:
7. Excessive hedging in Abstract (4 hedges in 250 words)
8. Nominalization throughout ("effectiveness of", "reduction in")
9. Subject-verb distance >10 words in Results
10. APA citation errors in References (missing DOI, "and" vs "&")

**RIGOR Problems**:
11. Reproducibility gaps (missing α for this sample, home practice compliance)
12. Waitlist control only (no active control)
13. Missing effect size confidence intervals

**NOVELTY Problem**:
14. Incremental gap (population substitution, not conceptual)

**Expected AI Diagnostic**:
- Reviewer 1: 7.2/10 (Minor Revision - methodological issues fixable)
- Reviewer 2: 4.2/10 (Major Revision - insufficient novelty)
- Reviewer 3: Major Revision OR re-target mid-tier journal

---

#### Example 5.2: AI Reviewer Reports (1,710 lines)
**Purpose**: Show complete AI Diagnostic outputs for Example 5.1 paper

**Structure**:
- Reviewer 1 (Methodological Rigor): 7.2/10 → Minor Revision
- Reviewer 2 (Theoretical Contribution): 4.2/10 → Major Revision
- Reviewer 3 (Supportive Critical Friend): Synthesis → Major Revision OR re-target

**Reviewer 1 Feedback** (Methodological):
- **Reproducibility**: 7/10 (missing recruitment period, α for this sample, home practice data)
- **Control Strategy**: 6/10 (waitlist only, doesn't control for expectancy/social interaction)
- **Sample Size**: 8/10 (adequate N=80 for d=0.72)
- **Statistical Rigor**: 7/10 (missing assumption checks, CIs for effect sizes)
- **Transparency**: 8/10 (all results reported)
- **Decision**: Minor Revision (1-2 weeks to fix)

**Reviewer 2 Feedback** (Theoretical):
- **Gap Quality**: 3/10 (Incremental - population substitution, not conceptual)
- **Novelty**: 4/10 (Findings predictable from meta-analyses)
- **Theory Advancement**: 3/10 (Mediation standard, not novel)
- **Broader Impact**: 4/10 (Limited to college mental health)
- **Literature Integration**: 7/10 (Good review, but doesn't identify conceptual gap)
- **Decision**: Major Revision OR Reject for Psychological Science (re-target mid-tier recommended)

**Reviewer 3 Synthesis**:
- **Agree with R1?** Partially (issues real but all fixable)
- **Agree with R2?** Fully (incremental gap is core problem)
- **Greatest Strength**: Rigorous RCT with large effect size
- **Greatest Weakness**: Insufficient theoretical novelty for top-tier
- **Decision**: Major Revision (2-3 months, risky) OR Re-target mid-tier (1-2 weeks, safer)
- **Recommendation**: Option 2 (re-target mid-tier) - high quality applied research, appropriate fit

**Learning Points**:
- Not all reviewers agree (realistic peer review dynamics)
- Methodological rigor ≠ theoretical novelty (both needed for top-tier)
- "Major Revision" doesn't mean "bad paper" - means "wrong target journal or needs reframing"
- Applied research has value even without groundbreaking theory

## Design Patterns Established

### Cross-Week Consistency

**Canvas Structure** (maintained across Weeks 3-5):
- 3840×2160px total (Figma standard)
- 800px left panel (reference materials, criteria, checklists)
- 3040px right panel (student work zones)
- Student zones: 700-1400px width depending on activity

**Workshop Timing**:
- Week 3: 3 workshops × 20-25 min = ~70 min total
- Week 4: 4 workshops × 20-25 min = ~85 min total
- Week 5: 2 workshops × 25 min (AI Diagnostic + 3-Pass) + 15 min (Peer Review) = 65 min total

**Example Patterns**:
- Bad→Good pairing (show problems first, then solutions)
- Before→After transformations (specific text changes with exact improvements)
- Scoring rubrics (0-5 scales with clear thresholds)
- Practice exercises ("Your Turn" activities)
- Self-check questions (metacognitive prompts)

### Pedagogical Scaffolding

**Progression Across Materials**:
1. **Templates**: Provide structure and AI prompts
2. **Examples**: Show realistic application with problems and solutions
3. **Peer Review**: Students apply criteria to each other's work
4. **Recipe Library**: Students share what worked (cumulative knowledge)

**Learning Principles Applied**:
- **Cognitive load management**: 3-Pass Revision breaks complex task into manageable chunks
- **Metacognition**: Reflection zones in all templates
- **Peer learning**: Recipe sharing, peer review rubrics
- **Immediate application**: Students use tools on own papers in workshop
- **Hierarchical organization**: Macro → Meso → Micro (fix big problems first)

## Token Efficiency Analysis

**Total Usage**: 138,531 / 200,000 tokens (69% used)
**Remaining**: 61,469 tokens (31% buffer)

**Average File Size**:
- Week 5 Templates: 1,411 lines average (range: 1,165-1,780)
- Week 5 Examples (so far): 1,815 lines average (range: 1,710-1,920)

**Projected for Remaining Work**:
- Week 5 Examples (4 remaining): ~7,260 lines (~36K tokens)
- Week 6 Templates (4 files): ~5,640 lines (~28K tokens)
- Week 6 Examples (6 files): ~10,890 lines (~54K tokens)
- **Total projected**: ~23,790 lines (~118K tokens)

**Budget Check**:
- **Remaining tokens**: 61,469
- **Projected need**: ~118K tokens
- **Gap**: Need ~57K more tokens (currently SHORT)

**Recommendation**:
Given token constraints, I should either:
1. Compress remaining files (shorter examples, key content only)
2. Prioritize most critical files (complete Week 5 first, then start Week 6)
3. Create summary versions and detailed versions separately

## Lessons Learned & Recommendations

### What Worked Well

1. **Consistent Structure**: Maintaining 3840×2160px canvas across all weeks ensures instructor familiarity
2. **Real Examples**: Using complete realistic papers (not toy examples) increases student engagement
3. **Multi-Level Diagnosis**: Showing Macro/Meso/Micro problems demonstrates need for systematic revision
4. **AI Reviewer Simulation**: 3-reviewer approach (methodological, theoretical, synthesis) mirrors real peer review
5. **Recipe Library Concept**: Cumulative knowledge sharing leverages collective intelligence

### Improvements for Week 6

1. **Compress Where Possible**: Week 6 materials can be more concise (students now familiar with format)
2. **Prioritize Templates Over Examples**: Templates are used in workshop (essential), examples are reference (nice-to-have)
3. **Lean Toward Summary Tables**: Instead of paragraph-by-paragraph examples, use structured tables/checklists
4. **Link to External Resources**: For Week 6 (Proposal Writing), can reference online resources (NIH, NSF proposal guides) rather than reproducing content

### Token Budget Management

**Remaining Files** (14 total):
- Week 5 Examples: 4 files (Priority: HIGH - complete current week)
- Week 6 Templates: 4 files (Priority: MEDIUM - workshop essentials)
- Week 6 Examples: 6 files (Priority: LOW - can create condensed versions)

**Strategy**:
1. Complete Week 5 examples (use ~35K tokens)
2. Create Week 6 templates (use ~25K tokens) → Total: 60K tokens (within 61K budget)
3. Week 6 examples: Create condensed versions if tokens allow, otherwise outline structure for instructor to expand later

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete Week 5, Partial Week 6
**Pros**: Week 5 fully done, Week 6 templates created, examples outlined
**Cons**: Week 6 examples incomplete
**Token Usage**: ~60K (within budget)

### Option 2: Streamline Remaining Files
**Pros**: All files created, but shorter/condensed
**Cons**: May lack detail compared to Weeks 3-5
**Token Usage**: ~60K (within budget)

### Option 3: Git Commit Now, Continue in New Session
**Pros**: Save progress, avoid context loss, resume with fresh token budget
**Cons**: Requires session handoff
**Token Usage**: None (new session)

**Recommended**: **Option 3** - Commit current progress to git, document what's done, what remains, and continue in fresh session with full token budget.
