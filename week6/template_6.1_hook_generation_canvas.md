## Example Fill-In (학생 A)

### 1️⃣ Problem-Driven Hook

**Hook**:
```
"Every year, 800,000 people die by suicide globally, yet our ability to predict who will attempt suicide remains no better than chance (Franklin et al., 2017). Current risk assessment tools rely on static self-report measures that fail to capture the dynamic nature of suicidal crises. This proposal aims to develop a real-time risk monitoring system by integrating digital phenotyping (passive smartphone data) with machine learning models that adapt to individual risk trajectories."
```

**Self-Rating**:
- Attention: 5/5 (dramatic statistic)
- Relevance: 5/5 (directly states research goal)
- Credibility: 4/5 (citation included, realistic proposal)
- Broad Sig: 5/5 (global health crisis)
- Clarity: 4/5 (clear but some jargon)
- **TOTAL**: 23/25

---

### 2️⃣ Opportunity-Driven Hook

**Hook**:
```
"Recent advances in passive sensing technology have created unprecedented opportunities to monitor mental health in real-time, outside clinical settings (Mohr et al., 2017). Unlike traditional assessments that capture single snapshots, smartphones can continuously track behavioral patterns—sleep, social activity, mobility—that signal shifts in psychological state. This proposal leverages these innovations to develop a suicide risk monitoring system that detects warning signs before crises occur."
```

**Self-Rating**:
- Attention: 4/5 (interesting tech angle)
- Relevance: 5/5 (clear connection)
- Credibility: 5/5 (grounded in real tech)
- Broad Sig: 3/5 (less emphasis on problem severity)
- Clarity: 5/5 (accessible language)
- **TOTAL**: 22/25

---

### 3️⃣ Challenge-Driven Hook

**Hook**:
```
"A central challenge in suicide prevention is that suicidal crises emerge and resolve rapidly, often within hours, making static risk assessments ineffective (Kleiman & Nock, 2018). Current clinical approaches rely on periodic check-ins that miss critical fluctuations in risk. I propose a continuous monitoring approach using passive smartphone data that captures moment-to-moment changes in behavior, mood, and social patterns, enabling dynamic risk prediction."
```

**Self-Rating**:
- Attention: 4/5 (identifies clear problem)
- Relevance: 5/5 (challenge-solution clear)
- Credibility: 5/5 (cites research, realistic)
- Broad Sig: 3/5 (clinical focus, less broad)
- Clarity: 4/5 (good but technical)
- **TOTAL**: 21/25

---

### 4️⃣ Vision-Driven Hook

**Hook**:
```
"Imagine a world where suicidal crises are detected and prevented before they escalate, where individuals at risk receive timely support without invasive interventions. To achieve this vision, we must move beyond static risk assessments to continuous, personalized monitoring systems. This proposal takes a critical first step by developing machine learning models that integrate passive smartphone data to predict suicide risk in real-time, bringing us closer to truly preventive mental health care."
```

**Self-Rating**:
- Attention: 3/5 (inspiring but less urgent)
- Relevance: 4/5 (vision-research link needs strengthening)
- Credibility: 4/5 (ambitious but achievable)
- Broad Sig: 5/5 (transformative vision)
- Clarity: 5/5 (very accessible)
- **TOTAL**: 21/25

---

### 5️⃣ Controversy-Driven Hook

**Hook**:
```
"Despite widespread belief that we can predict suicide risk using clinical interviews and self-report measures, recent meta-analyses show these methods perform no better than chance (Large et al., 2016). This paradox—that decades of research have not improved prediction—has critical implications for suicide prevention efforts. I propose investigating whether the failure lies not in what we measure (suicidal ideation) but when and how we measure it, by testing real-time passive monitoring as an alternative to static assessment."
```

**Self-Rating**:
- Attention: 5/5 (provocative paradox)
- Relevance: 5/5 (addresses field limitation)
- Credibility: 5/5 (strong evidence)
- Broad Sig: 4/5 (field-specific but important)
- Clarity: 4/5 (clear but assumes knowledge)
- **TOTAL**: 23/25

---

### Peer Feedback (from Student B)

```
Best Hook: #1 (Problem-Driven)
Why: Immediate emotional impact with "800,000 deaths"
     + "no better than chance" drives urgency.
     Most compelling opening.

Needs Improvement: #4 (Vision-Driven)
Why: "Imagine a world..." feels too abstract.
     Less urgency than Problem-Driven.
     Vision is inspiring but doesn't hook as strongly.

Suggested Edit (Hook #1):
"Every year, 800,000 people die by suicide globally—more than from war and homicide combined—yet our ability to predict who will attempt suicide remains no better than chance (Franklin et al., 2017). Current risk assessment tools rely on static self-report measures that fail to capture the dynamic, rapidly shifting nature of suicidal crises. This proposal aims to develop a real-time risk monitoring system by integrating smartphone-based digital phenotyping with machine learning models that adapt to individual risk trajectories."

Change: Added "more than war and homicide combined" for stronger comparison, and "rapidly shifting" to emphasize dynamic nature.
```

---

### Final Selection & Broad Significance

**Selected Pattern**: #1 (Problem-Driven)

**Reason**: Strongest attention-grabbing power + immediate urgency. Peer agreed this was most compelling. Problem-Driven best fits suicide prevention research (life-or-death urgency).

**Expanded Opening** (8 sentences):

```
Every year, 800,000 people die by suicide globally—more than from war and homicide combined—yet our ability to predict who will attempt suicide remains no better than chance (Franklin et al., 2017). Current risk assessment tools rely on static self-report measures administered during clinical visits, which fail to capture the dynamic, rapidly shifting nature of suicidal crises that often emerge and resolve within hours (Kleiman & Nock, 2018). This fundamental mismatch between static assessment and dynamic risk has persisted for decades, leaving clinicians unable to anticipate when patients will transition from ideation to action. The consequences are devastating: most individuals who die by suicide had recent clinical contact but were not identified as high-risk (Luoma et al., 2002), highlighting the urgent need for more sensitive, real-time monitoring approaches. Recent advances in passive sensing technology now make continuous mental health monitoring feasible, offering an unprecedented opportunity to close this prediction gap. This proposal aims to develop and validate a smartphone-based digital phenotyping system that uses machine learning to detect behavioral warning signs—changes in sleep, social activity, mobility, and phone usage patterns—enabling real-time suicide risk prediction. Success will provide clinicians with an objective, continuous monitoring tool that complements traditional assessments, potentially saving thousands of lives annually. This research represents a critical step toward truly preventive mental health care, where crises are detected and addressed before they escalate.
```

**Broad Significance Elements**:
- Sentence 1-3: Problem (Hook)
- Sentence 4: Consequences (urgency)
- Sentence 5: Opportunity (recent advances)
- Sentence 6-7: Proposed solution + impact
- Sentence 8: Vision (broader goal)

## Instructor Facilitation Guide

### Before Workshop (5 min setup)

**Prepare Figma Canvas**:
1. Copy this template to new FigJam board
2. Create 6-12 student columns (adjust for class size)
3. Label each column: "Student A", "Student B", etc.
4. Share edit link via chat/email

**On Screen** (projector):
- Display left panel (5 Hook Patterns + Criteria)
- Show timer: 10 min → 7 min → 3 min

---

### During Workshop

**Minute 0-2** (Setup):
- "Everyone click the link and find your column"
- "Review the 5 Hook Patterns on the left"
- "Goal: Try all 5, pick the best one"

**Minute 2-10** (Individual Work):
- Circulate and give quick feedback:
  - "Good start! Try adding a statistic to Hook #1"
  - "Hook #3's challenge is clear - nice!"
  - "Hook #5 needs stronger 'controversy' - what's the paradox?"
- Identify 1-2 strong examples to share later

**Minute 10-12** (Transition to Pairs):
- "Pair up with the person next to you"
- "Read all 5 of your partner's hooks (2 min)"
- "Fill in the Peer Feedback zone (5 min)"

**Minute 12-17** (Peer Feedback):
- Monitor pairs:
  - "Be specific in your feedback - which words/phrases work best?"
  - "Suggest concrete edits, not just 'make it better'"
- Share 1 example of great peer feedback:
  - "See Student C's feedback? Very specific edit suggestion!"

**Minute 17-20** (Final Selection):
- "Choose your best hook based on peer feedback"
- "Expand it to 6-8 sentences: Hook + Broad Significance"
- Quick full-class share (if time):
  - "Student B, your Problem-Driven Hook was excellent - read it for us?"

---

### After Workshop (Wrap-up)

**Debrief** (3 min):
- "Which pattern was most popular?" (show of hands)
  - Typically: Problem-Driven (40%), Opportunity-Driven (30%), Challenge-Driven (20%), Vision/Controversy (10%)
- "Why did Problem-Driven win?"
  - Answer: Urgency + emotional impact + clear gap
- "When would you use Vision-Driven instead?"
  - Answer: Long-term projects, aspirational research, career statements

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Not all hooks are created equal**: Match pattern to research type
2. **Statistics = attention**: Quantify the problem for impact
3. **Peer feedback calibrates**: What feels strong to you may differ from reader perception
4. **Expansion strategy**: Hook (grab) + Significance (why it matters) = complete opening

**Transition to Next Phase**:
- "Now you have a strong opening"
- "Next: Build the full 3-Stage Structure (Problem → Solution → Impact)"
- "Your Hook becomes the start of the Problem stage"

---

## Variations for Different Class Sizes

**Small Class (6-10 students)**:
- Use full 507px columns
- More time for whole-class sharing (25 min total)
- Each student reads their best hook aloud

**Medium Class (11-20 students)**:
- Reduce column width to 380px
- Keep 10min individual + 7min peer + 3min final
- Share 2-3 best examples, not all

**Large Class (21+ students)**:
- Use 304px columns (narrower)
- Organize into groups of 4 (2 pairs together)
- Group selects 1 best hook to share with class

---

## Common Student Mistakes & Fixes

**Mistake #1: Hook too narrow (jargon-heavy)**

**Example**:
```
"Resting-state fMRI studies have identified aberrant connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) of individuals with Major Depressive Disorder, but the relationship between DMN dysfunction and anhedonic symptoms remains unclear."
```

**Problem**: Only experts understand; no broader significance

**Fix**:

"Depression affects 300 million people worldwide, yet we still don't understand why some treatments work for some patients but not others. Recent brain imaging studies reveal that depression involves disrupted communication between brain regions responsible for self-reflection and reward processing. This proposal aims to map these brain network disruptions to specific symptoms, enabling personalized treatment selection."
```

**Change**: Jargon → Plain language, narrow → broad significance

**Mistake #2: Hype without substance**

**Example**:
```
"This groundbreaking, revolutionary research will completely transform our understanding of depression and save millions of lives through a paradigm-shifting approach to mental health."
```

**Problem**: All adjectives, no facts; no specific proposal

**Fix**:
```
"Depression affects 300 million people globally, with current treatments effective for only 50-60% of patients (Rush et al., 2006). This proposal will develop a precision medicine framework for depression by integrating brain imaging biomarkers with treatment response data, potentially doubling the rate of successful first-line treatment selection."
```

**Change**: Hype → evidence + specific goal + quantified impact

---

**Mistake #3: Missing the "So What?"**

**Example**:
```
"While previous studies have examined X in population A, no research has tested X in population B. This study will fill that gap by testing X in population B."
```

**Problem**: Incremental gap (population substitution) without justification

**Fix**:
```
"Childhood trauma affects 60% of adults, yet current PTSD treatments were developed for combat veterans, not childhood abuse survivors. These populations differ fundamentally: childhood trauma occurs during critical developmental periods, altering brain structure in ways that may require different therapeutic approaches. This proposal will test whether trauma-focused therapy needs to be adapted for developmental trauma, potentially improving treatment outcomes for the majority of PTSD cases."
```

**Change**: Why population B matters (not just "unstudied") + broader implications

## Assessment Rubric (for instructor use)

**Hook Quality** (10 points):
- Attention-grabbing (2 pts): Statistic, paradox, or compelling problem
- Broad significance (2 pts): Importance beyond narrow field
- Credibility (2 pts): Evidence-based, not hype
- Clarity (2 pts): Accessible to non-specialists
- Research connection (2 pts): Leads naturally to proposal

**Process** (10 points):
- All 5 patterns attempted (5 pts)
- Peer feedback provided (2 pts)
- Peer feedback incorporated (3 pts)

**Total**: 20 points

**Excellent** (18-20): All patterns tried, best hook selected with clear reasoning, peer feedback constructive and incorporated, expanded opening is compelling
**Good** (15-17): Most patterns tried, good hook selected, peer feedback helpful, expanded opening is solid
**Satisfactory** (12-14): Some patterns tried, acceptable hook, basic feedback, opening needs work
**Needs Improvement** (<12): Few patterns, weak hook, minimal feedback, opening unclear
