---

## 연구 주제

**Title**: "Real-Time Suicide Risk Monitoring Using Smartphone-Based Digital Phenotyping and Machine Learning"

**Core Idea**: Develop a smartphone app that passively collects behavioral data (sleep, social activity, mobility, phone usage) and uses machine learning to detect early warning signs of suicide risk 24-72 hours before a crisis.

**Target Funding**: NIH R21 (Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant)

---

## Hook Pattern 1: PROBLEM-DRIVEN

### Hook Text (3 sentences, 68 words)

```
Every year, 800,000 people die by suicide globally—more than from war and homicide combined—yet our ability to predict who will attempt suicide remains no better than chance (Franklin et al., 2017). Current risk assessment tools rely on static self-report measures administered during clinical visits, which fail to capture the dynamic, rapidly shifting nature of suicidal crises that often emerge and resolve within hours (Kleiman & Nock, 2018). This proposal aims to develop a smartphone-based digital phenotyping system that uses machine learning to detect behavioral warning signs in real-time, enabling timely intervention before crises escalate.
```

### Self-Rating (Template 6.1 Criteria)

- **Attention-Grabbing**: 5/5

⚠️ **Could Be More Personal**: Lacks human element (no patient story or case)

### Peer Feedback (from partner)

> "Your Problem-Driven Hook is the strongest. The statistic is devastating and the 'no better than chance' really drives home the urgency. I would use this one for an NIH submission. Only suggestion: Maybe add one sentence about a specific case or scenario to make it more personal?"

### When to Use This Pattern

✅ **Best for**: Life-or-death problems, clear failures in current approaches, NIH/medical research
✅ **Funding agencies**: NIH (emphasis on clinical significance), APA (applied psychology)
❌ **Not ideal for**: Exploratory/basic research, controversial topics (problem may seem exaggerated)

---

## Hook Pattern 2: OPPORTUNITY-DRIVEN

### Hook Text (3 sentences, 65 words)

```
Recent advances in passive sensing technology have created unprecedented opportunities to monitor mental health in real-time, outside clinical settings (Mohr et al., 2017). Unlike traditional assessments that capture single snapshots, smartphones can continuously track behavioral patterns—sleep, social activity, mobility—that signal shifts in psychological state. This proposal leverages these innovations to develop a suicide risk monitoring system that detects warning signs before crises occur, transforming reactive crisis response into proactive prevention.
```

### Self-Rating

  - "Unprecedented opportunities" is compelling
  - But less dramatic than Problem-Driven statistic
- **Relevance**: 5/5
  - Clear connection between tech advance and research goal
- **Credibility**: 5/5
  - Mohr et al. citation grounds it in real technology
  - Realistic promise ("detect warning signs" not "eliminate suicide")
- **Broad Significance**: 3/5
  - Focuses on technology opportunity, less on problem severity
  - Missing global/societal scale
- **Clarity**: 5/5
  - Very accessible language
  - "Smartphones" is universally understood

**TOTAL**: 22/25

✅ **Best for**: Technology-driven research, methods development, computational fields
✅ **Funding agencies**: NSF (innovation emphasis), industry grants, DARPA
❌ **Not ideal for**: High-stakes health outcomes (may seem insufficiently serious)

---

## Hook Pattern 3: CHALLENGE-DRIVEN

### Hook Text (4 sentences, 78 words)

```
A central challenge in suicide prevention is that suicidal crises emerge and resolve rapidly, often within hours, making static risk assessments ineffective (Kleiman & Nock, 2018). Current clinical approaches rely on periodic check-ins that miss critical fluctuations in risk between appointments. I propose a continuous monitoring approach using passive smartphone data that captures moment-to-moment changes in behavior, mood, and social patterns. Unlike episodic assessments, this system will enable dynamic risk prediction, alerting clinicians to high-risk periods in real-time.
```

### Self-Rating

- **Attention-Grabbing**: 4/5
  - "Central challenge" frames it as important field problem
  - "Within hours" creates time pressure
- **Relevance**: 5/5
  - Challenge-solution connection is crystal clear
- **Credibility**: 5/5
  - Kleiman & Nock citation supports claim
  - Realistic proposal (not claiming to solve all suicide)
- **Broad Significance**: 3/5
  - Clinical focus is clear but narrow
  - Missing broader societal/global context
- **Clarity**: 4/5
  - Good contrast (static vs dynamic, episodic vs continuous)
  - But "moment-to-moment" might oversimplify smartphone data

**TOTAL**: 21/25

### Strengths

✅ **Challenge-Solution Clarity**: Directly contrasts problem (static) with solution (dynamic)
✅ **Clinical Resonance**: Speaks to frustrations clinicians actually experience
✅ **Specific Limitation**: "Periodic check-ins miss fluctuations" is concrete
✅ **Professional Tone**: "I propose" signals expertise and confidence

### Weaknesses

⚠️ **Less Dramatic**: No big statistic or global scope
⚠️ **Assumes Problem Knowledge**: Requires reader to already care about suicide prevention
⚠️ **Narrow Framing**: Focused on clinical practice, less on public health

### Peer Feedback

> "Your Challenge-Driven Hook is very logical and clear. I can see exactly how your solution solves the challenge. But it feels a bit dry compared to the Problem-Driven version. Maybe for NIH, Problem-Driven is stronger? This might work better for a methodology paper or NSF Computer Science grant where you're showcasing the technical challenge."

### When to Use This Pattern

✅ **Best for**: Methodological innovations, engineering problems, CS/tech-focused grants
✅ **Funding agencies**: NSF Computer Science, engineering societies, technical journals
❌ **Not ideal for**: Broad audience proposals (assumes technical background)

## Hook Pattern 4: VISION-DRIVEN

### Hook Text (4 sentences, 90 words)

```
Imagine a world where suicidal crises are detected and prevented before they escalate, where individuals at risk receive timely support without invasive interventions. To achieve this vision, we must move beyond static risk assessments to continuous, personalized monitoring systems that adapt to individual behavioral patterns. This proposal takes a critical first step by developing machine learning models that integrate passive smartphone data to predict suicide risk in real-time. Success will bring us closer to truly preventive mental health care, shifting the paradigm from crisis response to proactive risk management.
```

### Self-Rating

- **Attention-Grabbing**: 3/5
  - "Imagine a world" is inspiring but less urgent
  - Lacks immediate hook (no statistic or shocking claim)
- **Relevance**: 4/5
  - Vision-research connection needs strengthening ("critical first step" helps)
  - But large gap between vision and specific proposal
- **Credibility**: 4/5
  - Ambitious but not unrealistic
  - "Critical first step" shows awareness of scope
- **Broad Significance**: 5/5
  - Transformative vision (paradigm shift)
  - Clear societal benefit (preventive care)
- **Clarity**: 5/5
  - Very accessible language
  - "Imagine a world" is universally understood

**TOTAL**: 21/25

### Strengths

✅ **Inspirational**: Creates aspirational goal that motivates funding
✅ **Patient-Centered**: "Timely support without invasive interventions" emphasizes welfare
✅ **Paradigm Framing**: "Crisis response → proactive management" signals field transformation
✅ **Accessible**: No jargon, anyone can understand the vision

### Weaknesses

⚠️ **Lacks Urgency**: Too abstract, doesn't convey immediate problem
⚠️ **Large Vision-Reality Gap**: "Imagine a world" vs "first step" creates disconnect
⚠️ **Risky for NIH**: Medical funders may see it as too speculative

### Peer Feedback

## Hook Pattern 5: CONTROVERSY-DRIVEN

### Hook Text (4 sentences, 90 words)

```
Despite widespread belief that we can predict suicide risk using clinical interviews and self-report measures, recent meta-analyses show these methods perform no better than chance (Large et al., 2016; Franklin et al., 2017). This paradox—that decades of research have not improved prediction—has critical implications for suicide prevention efforts worldwide. I propose investigating whether the failure lies not in what we measure (suicidal ideation) but when and how we measure it, by testing real-time passive monitoring as an alternative to static assessment. If successful, this approach could fundamentally challenge current clinical practice guidelines.
```

### Self-Rating

- **Attention-Grabbing**: 5/5
  - "Widespread belief" vs "no better than chance" is provocative
  - Paradox creates intellectual tension
- **Relevance**: 5/5
  - Hypothesis is clear (what vs when/how we measure)
  - Direct connection to proposed solution
- **Credibility**: 5/5
  - Two strong meta-analysis citations (Large; Franklin)
  - "If successful" shows appropriate humility
- **Broad Significance**: 4/5
  - "Worldwide" scope is good
  - "Challenge clinical practice guidelines" is high-impact
  - But missing quantification (how many lives?)
- **Clarity**: 4/5
  - "Paradox" is clear
  - But "what vs when/how" distinction needs unpacking

**TOTAL**: 23/25

### Strengths

✅ **Provocative**: Challenges field assumptions (grabs expert attention)
✅ **Evidence-Based**: Two meta-analyses make it hard to dismiss
✅ **Intellectual Framing**: "Paradox" appeals to scientific curiosity
✅ **Field-Changing Potential**: "Challenge clinical practice guidelines" signals importance

### Weaknesses

⚠️ **May Offend**: Implies field has been doing it wrong for decades
⚠️ **Requires Careful Phrasing**: "Widespread belief" could sound dismissive
⚠️ **High Bar**: Promising to "challenge practice guidelines" sets high expectations

### Peer Feedback

> "Wow, this Hook is bold! 'No better than chance' is a devastating indictment of current practice. I can see this grabbing expert reviewers' attention immediately. But be careful—some reviewers might be defensive if they've built careers on those methods. Maybe soften 'widespread belief' to 'common assumption'? Also, you need to deliver on this promise—if your data don't clearly show advantage over static methods, reviewers will be harsh."

### When to Use This Pattern

✅ **Best for**: Paradigm-challenging research, established fields needing disruption, expert audiences
✅ **Funding agencies**: NIH (if you have preliminary data), foundation grants (innovator awards)
✅ **Venues**: High-impact journals (Nature, Science) where paradigm shifts are valued
❌ **Not ideal for**: Early-career researchers without strong track record (seen as risky)

## Final Selection Process

### Student's Decision (for NIH R21)

**Selected Pattern**: **Problem-Driven**

**Reasons**:
1. **Highest Broad Significance** (5/5): NIH prioritizes health impact
2. **Emotional Impact**: "800,000 deaths, more than war and homicide" is impossible to ignore
3. **Safer**: Won't alienate reviewers (unlike Controversy-Driven's implicit criticism)
4. **Track Record**: Most successful NIH grants use Problem-Driven opening (observed in awarded R21s)

**Refinement from Peer Feedback**:
- Keep dramatic statistic and "no better than chance" (core strengths)
- Consider adding brief human element in sentence 4 (optional)
- Ensure "digital phenotyping" is explained more clearly in following paragraph

### Expanded Opening (Problem-Driven + Broad Significance)

**Final Hook + Context** (8 sentences, suitable for full proposal opening):

```
Every year, 800,000 people die by suicide globally—more than from war and homicide combined—yet our ability to predict who will attempt suicide remains no better than chance (Franklin et al., 2017). Current risk assessment tools rely on static self-report measures administered during clinical visits, which fail to capture the dynamic, rapidly shifting nature of suicidal crises that often emerge and resolve within hours (Kleiman & Nock, 2018). This fundamental mismatch between static assessment and dynamic risk has persisted for decades, leaving clinicians unable to anticipate when patients will transition from ideation to action. The consequences are devastating: most individuals who die by suicide had recent clinical contact but were not identified as high-risk (Luoma et al., 2002), highlighting the urgent need for more sensitive, real-time monitoring approaches.

Recent advances in passive sensing technology now make continuous mental health monitoring feasible, offering an unprecedented opportunity to close this prediction gap. This proposal aims to develop and validate a smartphone-based digital phenotyping system—using passively collected behavioral data (sleep patterns, social activity, mobility, phone usage)—combined with machine learning algorithms to detect warning signs 24-72 hours before suicide attempts. Success will provide clinicians with an objective, continuous monitoring tool that complements traditional assessments, potentially saving thousands of lives annually. This research represents a critical step toward truly preventive mental health care, where crises are detected and addressed before they escalate.
```

**Why This Works**:
- Sentences 1-4: Problem Setup (Hook + Consequences)
- Sentence 5: Opportunity (transitions from problem to solution)
- Sentences 6-7: Proposed Solution + Impact
- Sentence 8: Vision (broader significance)

**Structure**: Problem (30%) → Solution (50%) → Impact (20%) ✅

## Key Lessons from 5-Pattern Comparison

### 1. Pattern Selection Depends on Context

| Factor | Recommended Pattern |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Funding Agency** | NIH → Problem, NSF → Opportunity/Challenge, Foundations → Controversy |
| **Career Stage** | Early → Problem/Opportunity, Established → Controversy, Fellowship → Vision |
| **Audience** | Specialists → Controversy/Challenge, Broad → Problem/Vision, Public → Problem/Vision |
| **Field Maturity** | Established → Controversy, Emerging → Opportunity, Applied → Problem |

### 2. Strengths to Keep Across Patterns

Regardless of pattern chosen, successful Hooks have:
- ✅ **Quantification**: Statistics, numbers, concrete data
- ✅ **Citations**: Evidence from credible sources (meta-analyses > single studies)
- ✅ **Specificity**: Concrete details (not vague generalities)
- ✅ **Connection**: Clear link from problem/opportunity to solution

### 3. Common Mistakes to Avoid

Across all 5 patterns, avoid:
- ❌ **Hype**: "Revolutionary", "groundbreaking" without evidence
- ❌ **Vagueness**: "Important problem" without quantification
- ❌ **Disconnection**: Hook doesn't lead naturally to proposed research
- ❌ **Over-promising**: "Will solve suicide" (too big) vs "Will improve prediction" (realistic)

### 4. Iteration Strategy

**Don't stop at one pattern**:
1. Try all 5 patterns (10-15 minutes with AI assistance)
2. Self-rate using Template 6.1 criteria (5 minutes)
3. Get peer feedback (10 minutes)
4. Select best fit for target audience (5 minutes)
5. Refine selected Hook based on feedback (10 minutes)

**Total time**: ~45 minutes for high-quality Hook (vs hours of staring at blank page)

## Instructor Notes

### Teaching Points

**For Students**:
- "Notice how the same research can be framed 5 different ways—choose strategically!"
- "Problem-Driven and Controversy-Driven tied at 23/25, but Problem is safer for early-career"
- "Vision-Driven scored lowest for NIH, but would be perfect for a K-award career statement"
- "Pattern matters: NSF would prefer Opportunity/Challenge over Problem"

**Common Student Errors** (observed in workshops):
1. **Forcing the Wrong Pattern**: Student loves Vision-Driven but submitting to NIH → mismatch
2. **Not Trying All 5**: Student picks first pattern without comparison → missed better options
3. **Ignoring Peer Feedback**: Student's favorite ≠ most effective (need external calibration)

### Classroom Discussion Questions

1. "Why did Problem-Driven and Controversy-Driven both score 23/25, but we chose Problem for NIH?"
   - Answer: Lower risk of offending reviewers, aligns with NIH's health urgency priority

2. "When would you use Vision-Driven instead?"
   - Answer: Career statements, K-awards, TED talks, public engagement (not research proposals)

3. "Could we combine patterns? Like Problem + Opportunity?"
   - Answer: Yes! Example opening did exactly this (Problem sentences 1-4, Opportunity sentence 5)

4. "What if all 5 patterns score low (<18/25)?"
   - Answer: Your research gap may not be compelling—revisit Week 3 gap validation
