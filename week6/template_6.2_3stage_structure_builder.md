## Workshop Workflow (30분)

### Step 1: Individual Work - Solution Proposal (10분)

**Minute 0-10**: Design Solution

**Task**:
- AI Prompt #8: Core Innovation 1-sentence summary
- AI Prompt #9: 3 Specific Aims generation
- AI Prompt #10: Methodology Overview
- Fill in Timeline (Years 1-3)

**Instructor Guidance** (circulating):
- "Make sure each Aim is necessary but also independently valuable"
- "Methodology should be detailed enough for expert to judge feasibility"
- "Don't forget to mention controls and validation"

**Common Issues to Watch**:
- **Too vague**: "We will investigate X" (no specific methods)
  → Fix: "We will investigate X using [method], measuring [variables]"
- **Aims overlap**: Aims 2 and 3 sound too similar
  → Fix: Ensure clear progression (Foundation → Mechanism → Application)
- **Missing feasibility**: No mention of preliminary data or expertise
  → Fix: Add 1 sentence about related work or pilot data

---

### Step 2: Individual Work - Impact Articulation (10분)

**Minute 10-20**: Predict Impact

**Task**:
- AI Prompt #11: Immediate Impact (1-2yr)
- AI Prompt #12: Medium-term Impact (3-5yr)
- AI Prompt #13: Long-term Vision (10yr+)
- AI Prompt #14: Broader Impact (if NSF submission)

**Instructor Guidance**:
- "Be specific about immediate impact - how many papers, which journals?"
- "Medium-term adoption - who exactly will use your findings?"
- "Long-term vision should be inspiring but not hype"

**Common Issues to Watch**:
- **Too modest**: "This will publish 1-2 papers"
  → Fix: Also mention data sharing, tool development, student training
- **Hype**: "This will revolutionize the field"
  → Fix: "This could shift clinical practice by..."
- **Missing Broader Impact**: Only mentions academic contributions
  → Fix: Add societal benefit - who benefits beyond academia?

---

### Step 3: Group Discussion - Structure Coherence (10분)

**Minute 20-30**: Peer Review in Groups of 3-4

**Formation**:
- Instructor assigns groups of 3-4 students
- Each student shares their 3-stage structure
- Group uses Coherence Checklist (left panel)

**Discussion Questions** (on screen):
1. **Problem → Solution**: Does the Solution directly solve the stated Problem?
2. **Aim Logic**: Are the 3 Aims logically connected (Foundation → Mechanism → Application)?
3. **Feasibility**: Do you believe this is achievable in 3 years? Why or why not?
4. **Impact Realism**: Is the Impact ambitious but realistic (not over-promising)?
5. **One Coherent Story**: Can you read it as a single narrative from Problem to Vision?

**Peer Feedback Format** (each student gives feedback to 2 others):
- ✅ **Best aspect**: "Your [Problem/Solution/Impact] is strongest because..."
- ⚠️ **Needs work**: "I'm concerned about [specific issue]..."
- 💡 **Suggestion**: "Consider [specific improvement]..."

**Instructor Role**:
- Monitor group discussions
- Intervene if off-track or too superficial
- Share 1-2 excellent examples with whole class
- Address common issues (e.g., "Many of you have Aim overlap - let me show how to fix this")

## Example Fill-In (학생 A - Suicide Prevention Research)

### STAGE 1: PROBLEM SETUP (30%)

**Hook** (from Template 6.1):
```
Every year, 800,000 people die by suicide globally—more than from war and homicide combined—yet our ability to predict who will attempt suicide remains no better than chance (Franklin et al., 2017). Current risk assessment tools rely on static self-report measures administered during clinical visits, which fail to capture the dynamic, rapidly shifting nature of suicidal crises that often emerge and resolve within hours (Kleiman & Nock, 2018).
```

**+ Broad Context**:
```
This fundamental mismatch between static assessment and dynamic risk has persisted for decades, leaving clinicians unable to anticipate when patients will transition from ideation to action. The consequences are devastating: most individuals who die by suicide had recent clinical contact but were not identified as high-risk (Luoma et al., 2002), highlighting the urgent need for more sensitive, real-time monitoring approaches.
```

**+ Specific Gap**:
```
While passive sensing technology now makes continuous mental health monitoring feasible, no validated system exists for suicide risk prediction using smartphone-based behavioral data.
```

**+ Consequences**:
```
Without such tools, we continue to rely on assessment methods that miss critical warning signs, resulting in thousands of preventable deaths annually.
```

**Total**: 10 sentences (~250 words, ~1 page)

---

### STAGE 2: SOLUTION PROPOSAL (50%)

**A. Core Innovation**:
```
Unlike prior work which relies on static risk assessments, I will develop the first validated smartphone-based suicide risk monitoring system that uses machine learning to detect behavioral warning signs in real-time from passive sensor data.
```

**B. 3 Specific Aims**:

**Aim 1: Characterize behavioral signatures of suicidal crises using passive smartphone data**
```
I will conduct a prospective study with 200 high-risk psychiatric outpatients over 6 months, collecting passive sensor data (GPS, accelerometer, call/text logs, app usage) alongside daily self-reports of suicidal ideation. Using machine learning clustering methods, I will identify behavioral patterns (sleep disruption, social withdrawal, decreased mobility) that precede suicide attempts. Expected outcome: A validated set of 5-10 behavioral biomarkers with sensitivity >80% and specificity >70% for detecting heightened suicide risk 24-72 hours before crisis.
```

**Aim 2: Develop and validate a dynamic risk prediction model**
```
Building on Aim 1's behavioral signatures, I will develop a machine learning model (Random Forest and LSTM neural networks) that continuously updates individual risk scores based on real-time sensor data. The model will be trained on 70% of the sample and validated on the remaining 30%, with cross-validation across demographic subgroups to ensure fairness. Expected outcome: A model achieving AUC >0.85 for predicting suicide attempts within 72 hours, outperforming current static risk assessment tools (AUC ~0.50-0.60).
```

**Aim 3: Pilot-test the risk monitoring system in clinical practice**
```
I will deploy the validated model as a clinician-facing dashboard in two psychiatric clinics, where therapists receive daily risk alerts for their patients. Using a stepped-wedge design (10 therapists, 100 patients), I will evaluate implementation feasibility (therapist engagement, alert accuracy) and preliminary clinical outcomes (crisis response time, hospital readmissions). Expected outcome: High therapist acceptance (>80% find alerts useful), reduced time-to-intervention for high-risk patients (from 7 days to <24 hours), and preliminary evidence of reduced suicide attempts (exploratory).
```

**C. Methodology Overview**:

*Aim 1 Methods*:
```
Participants will be recruited from two outpatient psychiatric clinics serving high-risk populations (recent suicide attempt or hospitalization for suicidal ideation). After informed consent, participants will install a custom smartphone app that passively collects sensor data (no active input required). Daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys will measure suicidal ideation (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale). Behavioral features will be extracted using signal processing techniques (circadian rhythm analysis, social network metrics, location entropy). Unsupervised clustering (k-means, hierarchical clustering) will identify behavioral profiles associated with ideation peaks. Sample size (n=200) provides 80% power to detect medium effect sizes (d=0.5) in within-person analyses.
```

*Aim 2 Methods*:
```
Machine learning models will be trained using scikit-learn (Python) on time-series behavioral features from Aim 1. Two approaches will be compared: (1) Random Forest for interpretability and (2) LSTM neural networks for capturing temporal dependencies. Models will predict binary outcome (suicide attempt within 72 hours: yes/no) using 7-day rolling windows of behavioral data. Hyperparameter tuning via 5-fold cross-validation. Model fairness will be assessed across gender, age, and diagnostic subgroups using equalized odds metrics. External validation on independent sample (n=50) collected in year 3.
```

*Aim 3 Methods*:
```
Implementation will use a stepped-wedge cluster randomized design: clinics start with standard care, then add the risk monitoring dashboard at staggered intervals. Therapists receive automated daily emails with patient risk scores and behavioral trend visualizations. Semi-structured interviews with therapists (n=10) at months 3, 6, 9 will assess usability and barriers. Patient outcomes (crisis contacts, hospitalizations, suicide attempts) extracted from electronic health records. Intention-to-treat analysis using generalized linear mixed models accounting for clustering by therapist.
```

**D. Preliminary Data**:
```
In a 3-month pilot (n=30), I demonstrated feasibility: 87% retention, 92% daily EMA completion, and identified sleep disruption as a consistent pre-crisis signal (d=0.72). These data support the proposed full-scale study.
```

**E. Timeline**:
```
Year 1: Participant recruitment, data collection for Aim 1 (n=200), behavioral signature identification
Year 2: Model development (Aim 2), validation, refinement, IRB approval for clinical pilot
Year 3: Clinical pilot (Aim 3), external validation, dissemination (3 papers, open-source code)
```

### STAGE 3: IMPACT ARTICULATION (20%)

**A. Immediate Impact (1-2 years)**:
```
This research will directly produce three high-impact publications in journals such as JAMA Psychiatry and Psychological Medicine, documenting behavioral biomarkers, predictive models, and clinical pilot results. All data (de-identified sensor time-series, n=200) and code (Python analysis scripts, ML models) will be openly shared via OSF and GitHub, enabling replication and extension by other researchers. The validated risk monitoring system will be released as an open-source tool, allowing clinics worldwide to implement continuous suicide risk assessment. Additionally, two graduate students will be trained in digital phenotyping methods, machine learning, and clinical implementation research.
```

**B. Medium-term Impact (3-5 years)**:
```
Building on these findings, I anticipate adoption by 10-20 research labs investigating digital mental health biomarkers, accelerating discovery of behavioral signatures for other conditions (depression, psychosis, PTSD). The open-source monitoring system will be piloted in 5-10 clinical programs, with adaptations for different populations (adolescents, veterans, inpatient settings). Successful clinical validation will lead to integration into existing electronic health record systems, enabling scalable deployment. I will collaborate with professional organizations (American Psychological Association, National Institute of Mental Health) to develop implementation guidelines and training programs for clinicians.
```

**C. Long-term Vision (10+ years)**:
```
In the long term, this line of research could fundamentally transform suicide prevention from reactive crisis response to proactive risk management. If continuous behavioral monitoring becomes standard practice, we could detect and intervene in suicidal crises hours or days before they escalate, potentially preventing thousands of deaths annually. This approach also exemplifies precision medicine in mental health—moving from one-size-fits-all assessments to personalized, dynamic risk models that adapt to individual behavioral patterns. Beyond suicide, the methodology could extend to other acute psychiatric conditions (psychotic episodes, self-harm, substance relapse), creating a new paradigm of continuous mental health monitoring that complements traditional clinical care.

---

### During Workshop

**Minute 0-10** (Solution Proposal):

**Setup**:
- "Use your Hook from Template 6.1 as the Problem Setup foundation"
- "Now design your Solution - this is the core 50% of the proposal"
- "Use AI Prompts #8-10 to accelerate, but review critically"

**Circulating Feedback**:
- "Your Aims are overlapping - differentiate Aim 2 and 3"
- "Add 1 sentence about controls - how will you validate?"
- "Good innovation statement - very clear what's new!"
- "Timeline looks optimistic - consider extending Aim 1 to 1.5 years"

**Common Issues**:
1. **Vague Aims**: "We will explore X"
   → Fix: "We will test hypothesis Y using method Z"
2. **Missing Logic**: Aims don't build on each other
   → Fix: "Aim 2 requires Aim 1's results because..."
3. **Over-ambitious**: 5 Aims in 3 years
   → Fix: "3 Aims is standard - focus depth over breadth"

---

**Minute 10-20** (Impact Articulation):

**Setup**:
- "Now predict what will happen if your Solution succeeds"
- "Be specific about immediate deliverables - not just 'publish papers'"
- "Long-term vision should be inspiring but grounded"

**Circulating Feedback**:
- "Immediate impact is too modest - mention data sharing, tools, training"
- "Good Broader Impact - clear who benefits beyond academia"
- "Long-term vision is a bit hype - tone down 'revolutionize' to 'transform'"

**Common Issues**:
1. **No Broader Impact**: Only academic contributions
   → Fix: "Who benefits in society? Patients, clinicians, policymakers?"
2. **Unrealistic Timeline**: "Will change clinical practice in 2 years"
   → Fix: "Pilot in 2 clinics (yr 3) → broader adoption (yr 5-10)"
3. **Hype Language**: "Paradigm-shifting, revolutionary"
   → Fix: "Could fundamentally improve..." (modal verbs)

---

**Minute 20-30** (Group Discussion):

**Setup**:
- "Form groups of 3-4 (instructor assigns)"
- "Each person shares their 3-stage structure (2 min)"
- "Group gives feedback using Coherence Checklist"

**Facilitation**:
- Monitor groups - ensure they're using checklist, not just chatting
- If a group finishes early: "Now check the 30-50-20 proportion - does it match?"
- Share 1 strong example: "Student C's structure is excellent - notice how their Innovation directly solves their Gap"

**Wrap-up** (last 2 min):
- Quick poll: "How many of you have clear Problem→Solution connection?" (show of hands)
- Address most common issue: "Many proposals had Aim overlap - remember Foundation → Mechanism → Application"
- Transition: "Next, you'll expand Impact Pyramid in more detail"

---

### After Workshop (Debrief)

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **30-50-20 is not arbitrary**: Problem establishes need, Solution is the meat, Impact sells the vision
2. **"Therefore..." not "And then..."**: Each stage must necessitate the next
3. **Feasibility matters**: Reviewers worry "Can they actually do this?" - address upfront
4. **Specificity wins**: "3 papers in JAMA Psych" > "publish research"

**Common Student Mistakes**:
- Solution doesn't match Problem (misaligned gap-method)
- Aims are redundant or missing clear progression
- Impact is too vague or too grandiose
- Missing feasibility evidence (no preliminary data, no expertise statement)

**Transition to Next Activity**:
- "You now have a complete 3-Stage Structure"
- "Next: Impact Pyramid worksheet will expand your Impact section"
- "Then: AI Reviewer will stress-test your entire proposal"

## Common Student Mistakes & Fixes

### Mistake #1: Solution doesn't address Problem

**Example**:
```
Problem: "Current therapies for PTSD are ineffective for 40% of patients"
Solution: "I will test a new therapy in a different population (college students)"
```

**Issue**: Population substitution doesn't solve ineffectiveness problem

**Fix**:
```
Problem: "Current therapies for PTSD are ineffective for 40% of patients, particularly those with childhood trauma"
Solution: "I will test a developmentally-adapted therapy that targets childhood trauma's unique neural mechanisms"
```

**Change**: Solution directly addresses *why* current therapies fail for that subgroup

---

### Mistake #2: Aims are redundant

**Example**:
```
Aim 1: Test intervention A in population X
Aim 2: Test intervention B in population X
Aim 3: Test intervention C in population X
```

**Issue**: Three parallel studies, not a coherent program

**Fix**:
```
Aim 1: Identify neural mechanisms of intervention A in population X
Aim 2: Develop optimized intervention B based on Aim 1 mechanisms
Aim 3: Test intervention B in real-world settings (implementation)
```

**Change**: Foundation → Mechanism → Application progression

---

### Mistake #3: Impact is vague or hype

**Example (Vague)**:
```
"This research will advance our understanding of depression and improve treatments."
```

**Example (Hype)**:
```
"This groundbreaking research will revolutionize mental health care and save millions of lives."
```

**Fix**:
```
"This research will identify 5-10 behavioral biomarkers for depression (published in 2 papers), develop an open-source monitoring tool (adopted by 10-20 labs), and pilot-test in 3 clinical programs, potentially improving early detection rates from 30% to 60% within 5 years."
```

**Change**: Specific deliverables, realistic timeline, quantified impact

---

### Mistake #4: Missing feasibility demonstration

**Example**:
```
Solution: "I will develop a brain-computer interface for PTSD treatment."
```

**Issue**: No evidence researcher can actually do this (expertise? preliminary data? resources?)

**Fix**:
```
Solution: "Building on my lab's 5-year track record in neurofeedback (3 papers, R01 funding), I will extend our validated EEG-based protocol to develop a closed-loop neurofeedback system for PTSD. Preliminary data (n=15) show feasibility: 87% retention, 2.5-point PTSD symptom reduction."
```

**Change**: Added expertise, prior work, preliminary data to establish feasibility
