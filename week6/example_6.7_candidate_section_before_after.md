## ✅ AFTER: Narrative-Style (Compelling Story)

### Version 2A: Narrative Transformation

## CANDIDATE'S BACKGROUND

My fascination with how digital technology shapes adolescent mental health began unexpectedly during my junior year at Seoul National University (2015). While volunteering at a youth crisis center, I noticed that teenagers in distress often clutched their smartphones—not to call for help, but scrolling endlessly through social media feeds. This paradox—technology simultaneously connecting and isolating young people—became the focus of my honors thesis, where I interviewed 47 adolescents about their social media use and emotional regulation strategies. This work, which earned the Department's Undergraduate Research Award (2016), revealed that adolescents used social media paradoxically: seeking connection yet experiencing heightened social comparison and anxiety. But observational interviews couldn't answer my central question: What are the real-time, moment-to-moment relationships between digital behavior and emotional states?

Seeking quantitative rigor, I pursued my MA at Yonsei University (2017-2019) under Dr. Sunghee Kim's mentorship, learning ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology to capture real-time social media use and self-esteem fluctuations in college students. My MA thesis demonstrated that passive social media consumption (scrolling without posting) predicted decreased self-esteem within hours (β = -.34, *p* < .001), while active engagement (posting, commenting) showed the opposite pattern—findings published in my first first-author paper and recognized with the Outstanding MA Thesis Award (2019). However, this correlational work left two critical questions unanswered: (1) Could smartphone sensors passively detect depression risk without burdening users with surveys? (2) Could these real-time insights inform just-in-time interventions?

These questions shaped my PhD dissertation (2019-2023), where I combined machine learning with passive smartphone sensing (GPS, app usage, communication patterns) to predict adolescent depression severity. Working with 247 Korean adolescents over 6 months, I demonstrated that a random forest model using only passively-sensed behavioral features (no self-report) predicted PHQ-9 depression scores with high accuracy (AUC = 0.83, 95% CI [0.79, 0.87])—accuracy comparable to traditional clinical interviews but requiring no user burden. This work yielded three first-author publications in high-impact journals: machine learning methodology (*JMIR Mental Health*, 2022, cited 34 times), real-time depression dynamics (*Journal of Abnormal Psychology*, 2023), and a meta-analysis contextualizing these findings (*Clinical Psychology Review*, 2022, cited 67 times as co-first author). This body of work earned the Korean Psychological Association's Best Dissertation Award (2023) and established me as an emerging scholar in digital mental health.

My postdoctoral work at Stanford University (2023-present) under Dr. Jennifer Lee's mentorship has focused on translating these predictive models into actionable interventions. However, this translation has revealed three critical gaps in my training that limit my ability to become an independent investigator:

**(1) Intervention design and clinical trial methodology**: My work has been purely observational (EMA, passive sensing). To translate prediction into intervention, I lack training in just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) design, micro-randomized trial methodology, and human-computer interaction principles for intervention engagement. I can predict when adolescents are at risk, but I don't know how to design effective, scalable, smartphone-delivered interventions that they will actually use.

**(2) Advanced computational methods**: While I can build supervised machine learning models (random forests, gradient boosting), I lack expertise in reinforcement learning for adaptive intervention optimization, natural language processing for analyzing open-ended EMA responses, and Bayesian hierarchical models for individual-level prediction—all essential for next-generation digital mental health tools.

**(3) Implementation science and health disparities**: My samples have been primarily middle-class Korean adolescents with reliable smartphone access. To achieve my goal of reducing mental health disparities, I need training in community-engaged research methods, cultural adaptation of digital interventions, and addressing digital divides in underserved populations (rural areas, low-income families, North Korean refugees).

The proposed K99/R00 training will address these gaps through mentored coursework, hands-on research experience developing a smartphone JITAI for Korean American adolescents (K99 phase), and transition to independent investigation of culturally-adapted digital mental health interventions in underserved Asian American populations (R00 phase).

**Long-term career goal**: I will become an independent investigator leading a research program that harnesses ubiquitous smartphone technology to deliver scalable, culturally-responsive mental health interventions for underserved adolescent populations—reducing disparities in access to evidence-based care.

## 🎨 Transformation Process (How AFTER Was Created)

### Step 1: Find the Thread

**AI Prompt Used**:
```
Analyze my CV below and identify the central research question that connects
all my projects. What's the overarching narrative arc?

My CV:
[CV sections pasted]

Goal: Identify the "golden thread" that makes sense of apparently disconnected projects.
```

**AI Output**:
```
Central Research Question: "How can we harness ubiquitous smartphone technology
to understand and improve adolescent mental health?"

Narrative Arc:
1. Initial observation: Teens use technology paradoxically (connecting yet isolating)
2. Question 1: What are real-time relationships? → Answer: EMA methodology
3. Question 2: Can we passively detect risk? → Answer: Machine learning + passive sensing
4. Question 3: Can we intervene in real-time? → Answer: Current postdoc work (JITAIs)

The arc shows systematic progression from:
- Qualitative → Quantitative
- Self-report → Passive sensing
- Observation → Prediction → Intervention
- Cross-sectional → Real-time dynamics
```

**Key Insight**: The thread is methodological progression (qualitative → EMA → passive → intervention), not topic-hopping.

---

### Step 2: Create Compelling Opening

**AI Prompt Used**:
```
Transform this dry opening:

"2019-2023: PhD, Clinical Psychology, Yonsei University"

Into a compelling narrative opening that:
1. Starts with a vivid scene or specific moment
2. Poses a question or paradox
3. Connects to my research focus on digital tech and adolescent mental health
4. Hooks the reader's attention

Style: Professional but engaging, like opening of a Nature essay
```

**AI Output**:
```
My fascination with how digital technology shapes adolescent mental health began
unexpectedly during my junior year at Seoul National University (2015). While
volunteering at a youth crisis center, I noticed that teenagers in distress often
clutched their smartphones—not to call for help, but scrolling endlessly through
social media feeds. This paradox—technology simultaneously connecting and isolating
young people—became the focus of my honors thesis...
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Specific scene (crisis center, 2015)
- ✅ Vivid image (clutching phones, scrolling endlessly)
- ✅ Paradox stated (connecting yet isolating)
- ✅ Personal connection (volunteering experience)
- ✅ Links to research focus

---

### Step 3: Integrate Awards

**AI Prompt Used**:
```
I have these awards listed separately:

Awards:
- 2016: Undergraduate Research Award
- 2019: Outstanding MA Thesis Award
- 2023: Best Dissertation Award

Integrate them into my research narrative using the pattern:
"This work, which earned [award], revealed/demonstrated..."

Context for each award:
- 2016: Honors thesis on social media and anxiety
- 2019: MA thesis on EMA and self-esteem
- 2023: PhD dissertation on machine learning prediction of depression
```

**AI Output**:
```
[Paragraph 1]: "This work, which earned the Department's Undergraduate Research
Award (2016), revealed that adolescents used social media paradoxically: seeking
connection yet experiencing heightened social comparison and anxiety."

[Paragraph 2]: "My MA thesis demonstrated that passive social media consumption
predicted decreased self-esteem within hours—findings published in my first
first-author paper and recognized with the Outstanding MA Thesis Award (2019)."

[Paragraph 3]: "This body of work earned the Korean Psychological Association's
Best Dissertation Award (2023) and established me as an emerging scholar in
digital mental health."
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Awards in context of specific research
- ✅ Not a separate section
- ✅ Pattern: "work, which earned [award], revealed..."
- ✅ One award per major research stage

---

### Step 4: Identify Training Gaps

**AI Prompt Used**:
```
You are an NIH K99/R00 reviewer. Based on my background (observational research
using EMA and machine learning) and my goal (to develop smartphone-based interventions
for adolescent depression), identify 3 critical training gaps.

Requirements:
- Be specific (not "need more training in statistics" but "lack training in
  reinforcement learning for adaptive intervention optimization")
- For each gap, explain: (a) what I have, (b) what I lack, (c) why it matters
- Format as numbered list

My background:
- BA with psych + CS
- MA: EMA methodology, correlational
- PhD: Machine learning, passive sensing, prediction (not intervention)
- Postdoc: Starting to work on interventions but no formal training

My career goal:
Become independent investigator developing culturally-adapted digital mental
health interventions for underserved Asian American youth
```

**AI Output**:
```
Critical Training Gaps:

(1) Intervention design and clinical trial methodology
What you have: Expertise in observation and prediction (EMA, passive sensing, ML)
What you lack: Training in just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) design,
micro-randomized trial methodology, HCI principles for engagement
Why it matters: You can predict when adolescents are at risk, but you don't
know how to design effective smartphone interventions they'll actually use

(2) Advanced computational methods
What you have: Supervised machine learning (random forests, gradient boosting)
What you lack: Reinforcement learning for adaptive intervention optimization,
NLP for analyzing open-ended responses, Bayesian hierarchical models for
individual-level prediction
Why it matters: Next-generation digital mental health tools require these
advanced methods to personalize interventions in real-time

(3) Implementation science and health disparities
What you have: Research with middle-class Korean adolescents
What you lack: Community-engaged research methods, cultural adaptation frameworks,
addressing digital divides in underserved populations
Why it matters: Your career goal is reducing disparities in underserved Asian
American youth—requires expertise you don't currently have
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Specific skills named (not vague)
- ✅ Three-part structure for each gap
- ✅ Directly connected to career goal
- ✅ Justifies need for K99 training phase

---

### Step 5: Polish Narrative Flow

**AI Prompt Used**:
```
Polish this paragraph for better narrative flow. Current version feels choppy:

"My PhD dissertation (2019-2023) combined machine learning with passive smartphone
sensing. I predicted adolescent depression. I worked with 247 Korean adolescents.
The study lasted 6 months. I used random forest model. The model used passively-sensed
behavioral features. The accuracy was AUC = 0.83. This was comparable to clinical
interviews. This work yielded publications."

Improvements needed:
- Vary sentence structure (not all simple sentences)
- Use transitions ("however", "while", "demonstrating that")
- Integrate statistics naturally
- Connect to previous paragraph (EMA work)
```

**AI Output**:
```
These questions shaped my PhD dissertation (2019-2023), where I combined machine
learning with passive smartphone sensing (GPS, app usage, communication patterns)
to predict adolescent depression severity. Working with 247 Korean adolescents
over 6 months, I demonstrated that a random forest model using only passively-sensed
behavioral features (no self-report) predicted PHQ-9 depression scores with high
accuracy (AUC = 0.83, 95% CI [0.79, 0.87])—accuracy comparable to traditional
clinical interviews but requiring no user burden.
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Varied sentence structure
- ✅ Opening transition ("These questions shaped...")
- ✅ Participial phrases add detail without choppy sentences
- ✅ Statistics integrated naturally (not separate sentences)
- ✅ Dash used for emphasis (—accuracy comparable...)

---

## 🎯 Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: The Power of "However"

**Pattern**:
```
[Accomplishment statement] However, [what's still missing] ...
```

**Examples from AFTER**:
- "My MA thesis demonstrated X... However, this correlational work left two questions unanswered..."
- "This work established me as emerging scholar... However, this translation has revealed three critical gaps..."

**Why it works**:
- Acknowledges accomplishments without bragging
- Shows intellectual honesty
- Justifies need for further training
- Provides smooth transition to gap statements

---

### Lesson 2: Awards Earn Their Place

**Bad** (CV-style):
```
Awards:
- 2023: Best Dissertation Award
```

**Good** (Narrative-style):

Award (2023) and established me as an emerging scholar in digital mental health.
```

**Why it works**:
- Award connected to "body of work" (not isolated)
- Includes impact statement ("established me as emerging scholar")
- Natural integration, not forced mention

---

### Lesson 3: Publications Need Context

**Bad** (CV-style):
```
Park, M., & Kim, S. (2022). Machine learning prediction of depression from
smartphone data. JMIR Mental Health, 9(8), e38472.
```

**Good** (Narrative-style):
```

I have extensive expertise in machine learning, passive sensing, and adolescent
mental health research. I am ready to become an independent investigator.
```

**With gaps** (sounds like rising star needing strategic training):
```
While I can build supervised machine learning models, I lack expertise in
reinforcement learning for adaptive intervention optimization... To translate
prediction into intervention, I lack training in just-in-time adaptive
intervention design...
```

**Why it works**:
- Acknowledges current skills ("While I can...")
- Explicitly states what's missing ("I lack...")
- Explains why gap matters ("To translate prediction...")
- Justifies mentored K99 phase

---

## 💡 Advanced Variations

### Variation A: International Candidate Context

**Challenge**: How to frame international education positively

**Example Addition** (after education description):
```
My training reflects both Korean and U.S. research traditions. In Korea, I
gained rigorous quantitative methodology and large-scale data collection
infrastructure (Korean adolescent samples: N = 247 for PhD, N = 150 for MA).
My current Stanford postdoc provides expertise in cutting-edge intervention
design and implementation science, positioning me to bridge basic science and
clinical translation across cultural contexts.
```

**Why it works**:
- Reframes international background as strength (bidirectional knowledge)
- Highlights specific advantages (large N, infrastructure)
- Shows strategic career planning (combining Korean and US strengths)

---

### Variation B: Gap Year or Non-Linear Path

**Challenge**: Candidate took time off between MA and PhD

**Example Addition**:
```
Between my MA (2019) and PhD (2021), I spent two years as a research coordinator
at the Korean Institute of Mental Health, managing a national youth mental health
surveillance study (N = 5,247). This experience, while delaying my PhD, proved
invaluable—providing expertise in large-scale data management, multi-site coordination,
and policy-relevant research translation. Moreover, this work yielded two
co-authored publications and established collaborations that enhanced my
dissertation's impact.
```

**Why it works**:
- Acknowledges gap openly ("while delaying my PhD")
- Reframes as strategic career development
- Provides concrete benefits (publications, skills, collaborations)
- Shows productivity during gap year

---

### Variation C: Career Pivot or Field Change

**Challenge**: Candidate's early work was in different area (e.g., cognitive neuroscience → clinical)

**Example Addition**:
```
My research began in basic cognitive neuroscience (undergraduate work on attention
and working memory). However, a formative clinical practicum experience during
my first year of graduate school redirected my trajectory toward clinical
applications. I realized that understanding brain mechanisms was necessary but
not sufficient—I needed to develop interventions that improve real-world mental
health outcomes. This pivot from basic to translational research has been
deliberate and strategic, guided by a central commitment: bridging neuroscience
and clinical practice.
```

**Why it works**:
- Acknowledges shift openly ("redirected my trajectory")
- Provides compelling rationale (practicum experience)
- Reframes as strategic decision, not aimless wandering
- Shows coherent motivation across pivot

## 🎓 Discussion Questions for Workshop

### Question 1: Opening Strategies
**Prompt**: "Compare these three opening strategies. Which is most effective and why?"

**Opening A** (Scene-based):
```
My fascination with digital technology and adolescent mental health began during
a volunteer shift at a youth crisis center (2015), where I noticed teenagers
clutching smartphones—not to call for help, but scrolling through social media.
```

**Opening B** (Question-based):
```
Can smartphones—the same devices often blamed for adolescent mental health
crises—be harnessed to detect and prevent depression? This question has driven
my research for the past 8 years.
```

**Opening C** (Statistics-based):
```
Adolescent depression rates have doubled in the past decade, coinciding with
ubiquitous smartphone adoption. Understanding this relationship became my
research focus during my undergraduate studies at Seoul National University.
```

**Discussion points**:
- Which grabs attention most effectively?
- Which sets up research trajectory best?
- Which feels most authentic to candidate's personality?
- Can you combine elements from multiple openings?

### Question 2: Gap Specificity
**Prompt**: "Which gap statement is more effective?"

**Gap Statement A** (Vague):
```
I need additional training in advanced statistical methods and intervention
development to achieve my career goals.
```

**Gap Statement B** (Specific):
```
While I can build supervised machine learning models (random forests, gradient
boosting), I lack expertise in reinforcement learning for adaptive intervention
optimization—essential for personalizing just-in-time interventions to individual
users' changing mental states.
```

**Discussion points**:
- What makes B more effective?
- How does B justify the mentored K99 phase?
- How does B set up the training plan section?
- Can you make B even more specific?

### Question 3: Award Integration
**Prompt**: "Rewrite this CV-style award section in narrative style"

**Original**:
```
Awards:
- 2023: Best Dissertation Award, Korean Psychological Association ($1,000)
- 2022: Graduate Student Research Award, Yonsei University ($500)
- 2019: Outstanding MA Thesis Award, Yonsei University (recognition only)
```

**Challenge**:
- Integrate these three awards into 2-3 sentences
- Connect each to specific research it recognized
- Don't create a separate "Awards" section
- Use pattern: "This work, which earned [award], demonstrated..."

**Possible solution** (for discussion):
```
My MA thesis, which earned the Outstanding MA Thesis Award (2019), demonstrated
real-time relationships between social media use and self-esteem. This foundation
supported my dissertation research, recognized with both the Yonsei University
Graduate Student Research Award (2022) and the Korean Psychological Association's
Best Dissertation Award (2023)—the latter being the field's most prestigious
doctoral recognition in Korea.
```

### Real K-Award Examples (from K-Materials)

**Food Insecurity Researcher Pattern**:
```
"I have expertise in health literacy research (2 first-author publications).
However, I must still generate data supporting food insecurity as a causal
factor in obesity/diabetes development (Aim 1) and poor self-management (Aim 2)."
```

**Lessons**:
- ✅ Explicit "However, I must still..." pattern
- ✅ Connects gaps to specific Aims
- ✅ Shows what's accomplished vs what's needed

**IPF Researcher Pattern**:
```
"My research evolution: Undergrad (biomechanics) → Residency (molecular
mechanisms) → Fellowship (shifted to interstitial lung disease). Recent
accomplishments: NRSA award, 3 manuscripts submitted/accepted, collaborations
across GI/Transplant/International."
```

**Lessons**:
- ✅ Shows deliberate evolution (not random)
- ✅ Recent accomplishments listed concretely
- ✅ Collaborative network emphasized

## 🎯 Summary: Key Takeaways

### The Golden Rules

1. **CV-style listing → Compelling narrative**: Your life has led to this work
2. **Separate sections → Integrated story**: Awards/pubs woven into research arc
3. **Vague gaps → Specific training needs**: What you lack, why it matters
4. **Bragging → Evidence**: Let facts speak (citations, impact factors, awards in context)
5. **Passive → Active**: Use "I" and "my" throughout
6. **Choppy → Flowing**: Vary sentence structure, smooth transitions
7. **Generic → Personal**: Opening scene, central question, career vision

### The Transformation Formula

```
Compelling Opening (vivid scene or question)
    ↓
Stage 1: Early Research (honors thesis, initial question)
    + Award integrated into context
    ↓
"However, this couldn't answer X..."
    ↓
Stage 2: Graduate Training (MA work, methodological shift)
    + Publications with key findings
    + Award integrated
    ↓
"These questions shaped..."
    ↓
Stage 3: Doctoral Research (PhD dissertation, major contributions)
    + Multiple first-author papers highlighted
    + Award for body of work
    ↓
"However, this has revealed [number] critical gaps..."
    ↓
Gap 1: [Specific skill] - What I have vs what I lack vs why it matters
Gap 2: [Specific skill] - What I have vs what I lack vs why it matters
Gap 3: [Specific skill] - What I have vs what I lack vs why it matters
    ↓
"The proposed K99/R00 will address these gaps through..."
    ↓
Long-term career goal: [Ultimate vision]
```

### The Reviewer's Mental Checklist

When reviewers read your candidate section, they're asking:

1. ✅ **Is there a coherent research program?** (Not random projects)
2. ✅ **Does this person show intellectual growth?** (Evolution visible)
3. ✅ **Are they productive?** (Publications, not just promises)
4. ✅ **Are they recognized?** (Awards indicating peer validation)
5. ✅ **Why do they need MORE training?** (Gaps must be explicit and justified)
6. ✅ **Will they become independent?** (Career trajectory plausible)
7. ✅ **Is this person passionate?** (Personal connection to research)

Your narrative-style candidate section should answer YES to all seven.
